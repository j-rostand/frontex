Today the European Border and Coast Guard Agency concluded
negotiations with the Polish authorities on the Agency's Headquarters
Agreement. "The signing of the agreement is very important for the future
of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. We are very grateful for all the
effort made by the Polish authorities that allowed us to conclude this process
in a timely manner. This is a crucial development as the Agency is growing and
recruiting new staff. Having a seat agreement is going to make the Agency a
more attractive employer," said the Executive Director of Frontex Fabrice
Leggeri.
