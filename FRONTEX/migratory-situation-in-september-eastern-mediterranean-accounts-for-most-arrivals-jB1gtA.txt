In September, the number of detections of illegal border
crossings on Europeâ€™s main migratory routes rose 14% from the previous month to
more than 17 200 due to higher arrivals on the Greek islands in the eastern
Aegean. Despite the growing numbers in recent months, the total on all European
migratory routes for the first three quarters of 2019 was 19% lower at around 88
200.
