Intelligence Community (AFIC) Risk Analysis Course at the National Police
Academy in Avila, Spain. 
Participants from the AFIC network are take part in a
two-week course on risk analysis as part of the Strengthening of Africa Frontex
Intelligence Community project.

produce risk analysis and to enable effective cooperation by introducing common
standards. Students will discuss topics ranging from integrated border
management, fundamental rights to statistical analysis and report writing. 
AFIC was set up in 2010 to provide a framework for regular
information sharing about migrant smuggling and other border security threats
affecting African countries and the EU. The network includes 28 countries.
