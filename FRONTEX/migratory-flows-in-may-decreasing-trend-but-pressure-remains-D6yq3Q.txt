In May, some 12 100 irregular border crossings were detected on the main
 migratory routes into the EU, 56% fewer than in the same month of last 
year.In the first five months of 2018, the total number of irregular
 border crossings fell 46%Â  compared to a year ago to about 43 200, 
mainly because of lower migratory pressure on the Central Mediterranean 
route.
