Danish Immigration
Minister Inger Støjberg visited Frontex on Thursday 16 July, where she and the
agency’s Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri discussed the exceptional migratory
and refugee situation facing the European Union and the related challenges for
Frontex and Member States.

The head
of Frontex and the Danish Minister for Immigration, Integration and Housing also
talked about Denmark’s participation and contribution to Frontex activities. In
recent months, Frontex has tripled the budget for its joint operations in the
Mediterranean and increased the number of ships and officers taking part.


“Frontex
needs the support of Member States in joint operations in these exceptional
times and I hope we can count on the support of Minister Støjberg in our
efforts,” Leggeri said.
Frontex experts presented the
current state of play of Frontex-coordinated joint operations, illustrating the
main migration routes to the EU and Frontex’s coordinating role in the
implementation of the ‘hotspot approach’ proposed by the European Commission in
the framework of the European Agenda for Migration. 
The
meeting took place with the participation of the delegation from the Danish
Ministry for Foreigners, Integration and Housing composed of Uffe Toudal
Pedersenm, Permanent Secretary; Henrik Ankerstjerne, Deputy Permanent
Secretary; Andreas Højmark Andersen, Secretary to the Minister; and the Defense
Attaché at the Danish Embassy in Poland, Colonel Jan Ørstrup-Møller.
