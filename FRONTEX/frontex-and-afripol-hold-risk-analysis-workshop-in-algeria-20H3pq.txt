This week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, held the Joint Workshop on Risk Analysis and Cross-Border Crime in Algiers, Algeria, in cooperation with the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL).During the three-day workshop, over 40 participants from 13 countries representing North Africa and countries of the Nouakchott process, African Union bodies, European Commission, European External Action Service (EEAS) and other EU agencies, discussed risk analysis and its role in countering terrorism and cross-border crime in the EU, North Africa and the Sahel-Saharan region. The workshop, organised with the support of Europol and Cepol, confirmed the commitment of Frontex and AFRIPOL to deepen their partnership in the field of combating cross-border crime. It also highlighted the fact that information sharing is key to strengthening the fight against trafficking of human beings, as set by the African Union-EU Continent-to-Continent Dialogue on Migration.
