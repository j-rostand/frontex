Working Arrangements establishing a framework for cooperation between Frontex and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were signed today in Frontex headquarters in Warsaw. The purpose and content of the cooperation reflected in these Working Arrangements constitute a fair balance between the very different remits of Frontex and UNHCR and a common goal to promote an efficient EU integrated border management system, which is fully compliant with human rights. Among the main objectives are exchange of information, expertise and experiences, in particular on mixed migratory movements towards EU Member States. Another key element is preparation of general and specific training materials and tools on international human rights and refugee law applicable to the context of border management. Todayâ€™s official exchange of letters between Frontex and UNHCR is a clear proof of the commitment to cooperate.
