On 9 and 10 March 2009, Frontex representative attended the 7th Plenary session of the European Security Research and Innovation Forum (ESRIF), held in Berlin. ESRIF is an advisory group established in September 2007 by EU member states and the Commission to bring together civil security experts from academia, government and industry. Its objective is to develop a mid and long term agenda for civil security research and innovation. 
Discussions centered on preparations for the publication of ESRIF's final report ahead of the Fourth European Security Research Conference to be held in Stockholm in September 2009. Frontex was given a lead role in the drafting of the report, which is expected to play a key part in the development of future security research policy in Europe. Frontex also continues to chair ESRIF Working Group 3 on Border Security.
