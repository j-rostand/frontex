This week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, hosts a conference on the use of biometrics at the borders. This year,
the conference focuses on the growing challenge of the use of morphed images of
faces in identification documents to fool officials and computer systems. 
The International Conference of Biometrics for Borders brings
together experts and practitioners to discuss the various challenges and
opportunities related to the use of biological or physical characteristics to
identify individuals by law enforcement authorities.
“In today’s world we can no longer rely solely on
traditional means of border control to assure a steady flow of travellers
across borders and protect the security of our citizens at the same time,” said
Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
“One of the key tools for the border guard authorities, of
course, is new technology, especially biometric solutions. The right biometric
solutions can have the power to allows genuine travellers to cross borders more
smoothly, while allowing law enforcement authorities to identify potential
threats more efficiently,” he added.
