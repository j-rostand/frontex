In the first half of 2018, the total number of irregular border crossings into the EU nearly halved from a year ago to about 60 430, mainly because of lower migratory pressure on the Central Mediterranean route. In June, some 13 100 irregular crossings were detected on the main migratory routes into the EU, 56% fewer than in the same month of last year.
