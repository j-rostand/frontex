In February, 3 400 irregular
border crossings were detected on the four main migratory routes into the EU,
down nearly three-quarters from the year-ago period.
In the first two months of
this year, the total number of irregular border crossings almost halved to 12
000, in large part due to lower migratory pressure on the Central Mediterranean
route.
Central Mediterranean
The number of migrants
arriving in Italy via the Central Mediterranean route in February fell to below
800, less than one-tenth of the figure from the same month of 2017. The total
number of migrants detected on this route in the January-February period fell
by 61% to 5Â 200.
As the number of migrant
boats leaving the Libyan shores plunged last month due to increased activities
of the Libyan Coast Guard and poor weather conditions.

So
far this year, Eritreans have been the largest group of migrants detected on
this route, followed by nationals of Tunisia.
