With the expansion of its role and
activities as the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex is looking to
significantly increase the size of its staff over the next three years. This
year alone, the agency aims to increase its staffing level to 600 from the
current level of about 400. 
Statutory staff, based on their
levels and areas of expertise, will be allocated mostly to the following fields
of work: assessment and analysis, return activities, operational activities
(land, air, and sea), management of pooled resources, liaison officers, Situation
Centre/EUROSUR activities, ICT, HR, finance and procurement, communication, and
legal affairs. Frontex is offering employment based on five-year renewable contracts.
Seconded National Experts (SNEs),
coming from relevant EU Member States/Schengen Associated Countries
institutions, remain employed by their national employer but are deployed to
work temporarily for Frontex (renewable two-year terms, for a maximum of six
years). SNEs will be primarily allocated to the following fields of work:
analysis, return activities, operational activities (land, air, and sea), and
Situation Centre/EUROSUR activities.
