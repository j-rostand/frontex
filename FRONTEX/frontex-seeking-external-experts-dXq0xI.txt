Frontex is setting up a database of external
experts that will allow candidates to apply to work for the agency on specific
projects or activities. Frontex will assign these experts to various tasks for up to
300 working days on the basis of their skills, experience and knowledge. The
candidates who satisfy the pre-defined criteria will be pre-selected and
included in the database. The established database will be valid until the end of
September 2020.The agency identified 47 expert profiles including: fundamental
rights monitoring, false document detection training, advising on information
management and interpreters/cultural mediators.Candidates interested in providing services in accordance
with these profiles and fulfilling the requirements are invited to send their completed
and signed applications to Frontex. Only candidates from EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries may apply. Incoming applications will be
evaluated at least on a quarterly basis.
