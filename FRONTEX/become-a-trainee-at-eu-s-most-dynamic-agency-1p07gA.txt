Registration for the March 2020 traineeship session at the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is now open. Frontex offers up to 60 paid traineeships per year through the Blue Book Traineeship
Programme. 

Frontex is undergoing fundamental changes to provide even stronger support
to Member States at the EU external borders. And you can be a part of this
transformation.
In recent years we have become a key actor at the European level to address
irregular migration and cross-border crime at the external borders. We are
about to begin building the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps, an
ambitious task that will set the path for Europe’s security for years to come. 
We have expanded at a fast rate and filled our ranks with fresh skills and
ideas, making Frontex EU’s most dynamic agency. That dynamism makes us one of
the most exciting European Institutions for young people seeking work
experience.
If you have completed your studies and are looking to put your knowledge to
work in the service of the European project, do not miss this opportunity.
We offer paid five-month traineeship (currently EUR 1 185 per month)
starting on either 1 March or 1 October.
