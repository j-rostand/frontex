In the first nine months of 2018, the number of irregular border 
crossings into the EU via the top four migratory routes fell by a third 
from a year ago to about 100 100, mainly because of lower migratory 
pressure on the Central Mediterranean route.In September, some 12
 900 irregular crossings were detected on the main migratory routes into
 the EU, 21% fewer than in the same month of last year.
