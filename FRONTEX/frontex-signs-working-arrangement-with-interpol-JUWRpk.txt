On 27 May 2009, in San Marino, Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen and the Secretary General of INTERPOL Ronald K. Noble signed a working arrangement on cooperation. The purpose of the arrangement was to establish a framework for cooperation between these two institutions facilitating the prevention, detection and suppression of cross-border crime, in particular in terms of border security to combat illegal immigration, smuggling of people and trafficking in human beings. The cooperation between INTERPOL and Frontex includes, among others, provision of mutual assistance for intelligence-driven joint operations, production of joint intelligence products (reports, threat and risk assessments), organisation of joint training activities and conferences, and provision of mutual assistance in fostering research and development. Frontex has so far signed working arrangements with EUROPOL, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and a number of relevant EU bodies.
