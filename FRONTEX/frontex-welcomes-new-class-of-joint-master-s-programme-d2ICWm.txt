This week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, welcomed the 34 members of the third class of the European Joint
Master’s in Strategic Border Management.
The Joint Master’s programme is Europe’s only such
specialised degree for border professionals. It reflects one of Frontex’s core
commitments to support training and professional education of national border
guards by strengthening common training standards at the European level. 
Since 2012, Frontex has been leading the development of the
European Joint Master’s in Strategic Border Management in collaboration with
experts and academics from more than 20 countries and international
organisations.
