Frontex’s photo contest,
"Ties that Bind: Bridging borders in modern Europe" is now
closed. First place was taken by Marcin Klepacki for his picture "Crossroads."
 
Curtis Budden, a professional
photographer commissioned to judge the entries, said the winning image, “gives
the viewer plenty of room for interpretation. [...] The photographer uses
leading lines and a shallow depth of field to direct us to the real subject of
the image, which is not the bridge but the man standing on it. The fact that we
cannot see what he sees adds an element of wonder to the photo. We are left to
[...] think about what physical or psychological frontiers he might be trying
to cross at that moment.” 
While the winner was rewarded for
technical and artistic merit, the second prize was won for another important
criterion — relevance to the competition topic — by reflecting the distinctive
nature of European borders. Curtis Budden said of the work: "By placing
two border posts in such a prominent position, we are left with no doubt that
this is a border. But what we do not see are border guards or fences or any
other form of separation. Instead, we can look out, unhindered, on the
marvelous landscape of the Carpathian Mountains."  
Third place went to Jose Cordoba
for his picture of the Strait of Gibraltar from the Spanish coast, overlooking
Morocco just 14 kilometres across this natural border. 
"The photographer uses his
vantage point and composition to emphasize this proximity: our eye is led into
the frame to a radar station that rises up into the Moroccan mountains across
the Strait. We feel almost as if we could just reach across and touch them. At
the same time, it is difficult to look at this image without thinking about
what one would see standing on those mountains and looking toward Europe."    
Honourable mentions were given to
Mateusz Piątek and Christian Skerbic for their photos of a trail through the
Tatra Mountains on the Poland-Slovakia border and a footbridge connecting
France and Germany across the Rhine, respectively.
All five photographers will have
their pictures exhibited at this year’s European Day for Border Guards (ED4BG)
in Warsaw on May 23. 
Frontex would like to extend its
gratitude and appreciation for all those who took part.
