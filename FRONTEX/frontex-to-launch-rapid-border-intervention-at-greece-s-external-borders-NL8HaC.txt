The Executive Director of Frontex has agreed today to launch a rapid border intervention to assist Greece in dealing with the large numbers of migrants at its external borders. The Greek government officially asked Frontex last night to launch a rapid border intervention at its sea borders in the Aegean.Rapid border interventions are designed to bring immediate assistance to an EU Member State that is under urgent and exceptional pressure at its external border, especially related to large numbers of non-EU nationals trying to enter its territory illegally.
“Given the quickly developing situation at the Greek external borders
with Turkey, my decision is to accept to launch the rapid border intervention
requested by Greece. It is part of the Frontex mandate to assist a Member State
confronted with an exceptional situation, requesting urgent support with
officers and equipment from all EU Member States and Schengen Associated
Countries,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
“Starting next year we will be able to rely on the first 700 officers
from the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps to provide operational
flexibility in case of a rapid border intervention. Today, we depend entirely
on EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries for contributions to come
through at this crucial time,” he added.
