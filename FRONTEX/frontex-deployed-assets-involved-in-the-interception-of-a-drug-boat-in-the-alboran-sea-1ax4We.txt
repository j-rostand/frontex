On 24 September a drug trafficking boat was
intercepted in the Western Mediterranean in the framework of the Frontex-
coordinated operation, Indalo. While conducting surveillance activities in the
Alboran Sea, theÂ  Italian Guardia di
Finanza plane, deployed by Frontex, detected a yacht suspected of drug
trafficking. The plane immediately informed the operation coordination centre
in Madrid which in turn deployed several vessels, including the French navy and
Spanish Guardia Civil patrol boats. After a pursuit that lasted several hours,
the drug boat was intercepted by the Guardia Civil in the international waters.
The yacht, registered in the UK, was carrying 13 tonnes of hashish divided into
over 500 individual packages. The market value of the seized drugs destined for
the European market is estimated at EUR 20 million. Three crew members, two
Spaniards and one Lithuanian were arrested by the Spanish authorities.
The Frontex joint operation Indalo supports
the Spanish authorities with border control activities in the Western
Mediterranean. The Frontex deployed assets include surveillance planes and
patrol vessels. Although border control is the primary aim of the operational
assets deployed by Frontex, they also contribute to EU maritime security by
sharing operational information such as drug boat detection.
