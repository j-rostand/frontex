One of the key objectives of Frontex is to keep
Member States informed about new technological developments in the field of
border control. In this regard, Frontex seeks to put more emphasis on organizing,
with the help of Member States, practical demonstrations of new technologies.Surveillance of EU external borders has to
ensure effective detection of irregular immigration activities. The technical
systems involved include different types of sensor and specific communication
systems and software, in order to create a situational picture and to make it
available to participants involved in a specific operation.Hovering electro-optical systems (together with
other sensor systems) can play important roles in further enhancing border
surveillance filling the gaps not covered by other border surveillance
activities. These technologies are also of relevance for the development of the
common European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR).Frontex Research and Development Unit in cooperation
with the Finnish Border Guard is organizing a demonstration and workshop,
during which relevant industry will present to Member States’ experts the
latest achievements on "Hovering electro-optical systems" for sea and
land border surveillance.The main objective of the event is to facilitate a
dialogue between industry, Member States and Frontex on current developments in
sea surveillance and land border surveillance and future developments with
regards to above mentioned technologies.Frontex therefore
will invite relevant industry to present its latest achievements in this
domain.Four to six leading companies in the field of
border surveillance technology will demonstrate their systems’ capabilities in
real operational scenarios. Each system
deployed is expected to cover at least the following indicative requirements:not
micro-solutions but mini-solutionswired
solution or freely flying solution (aerostats and balloons are not on focus for
this event)max
weight 30kgpayload:
2 kg or more…max
wind speed: 12 m/s or bettersilentmodes:
manual and automatic way point flight (if freely flying solution)altitude:
wired solution at least 30 meters, freely flying solution at least 300 metersflight
endurance: at least 30 minutesExclusions:

This
event will NOT explore fixed wing solutionsThe place and time will be Finland, in Helsinki
on board a patrol vessel and on a small airfield with a forest area near Imatra,
during week 23 (June 2014).Key stakeholders and representatives of EU
Member States’ authorities involved in border control will attend.The event will also give potential users and
industry the opportunity to meet each other and to exchange their views,
experience and needs.Please note that participants will be selected
on a first-come-first-served basis, but in a way that ensures representation of
the scope identified above. In order to participate in the event under the
above mentioned specifications, please express your interest and send
the description of your proposed system at the latest by 15 April 2014 to zdravko.kolev@frontex.europa.eu and harri.ahonen@raja.fi.You will be informed of a decision, by email, not
later than 25 April 2014Attendance
is free of charge, but please be informed that participants will be asked to
cover the cost of shipment/installation and any other costs incurred for
participating in the event. Once a company is selected it has the obligation to
perform the demonstration. After selection, field visits will also be organized
in order to establish the exact location for the demonstration and to address
further details regarding its implementation. More practical details will be sent only to the
selected participants.
