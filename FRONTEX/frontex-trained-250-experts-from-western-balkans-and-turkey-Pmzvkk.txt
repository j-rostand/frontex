On 16 May,
Frontex together with representatives of the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO), International Organization for Migration
(IOM), the office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other local partners in Belgrade,
Serbia, discussed the achievements of the first phase of the
EU-funded “Regional Support to Protection-Sensitive Migration Management
in the Western Balkans and Turkey” project.
The aim of the project was to introduce and share EU
standards and best practices on migration management in the Western Balkan
region and Turkey. 
Frontex and its partners supported the countries in
developing a protection-sensitive response to migration flows, assisting them
in strengthening systems that aim at better identification and referral of
those migrants that are in need of international protection or asylum.
