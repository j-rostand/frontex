On 28 June-8 July, Frontex, the European Border and Coast
Guard Agency, led an international operation against serious and organised
cross-border crime in Central and South Eastern Europe. 

The operation, known as Joint Action Day (JAD) Danube 4
focused on combatting the smuggling of migrants and document fraud. It was co-led
by Austria, where a coordination centre was put in place to support the
exchange of intelligence among the participants. Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece,
Hungary, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North
Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia also took part in the action. EU agencies and
international organisations, such as Europol and Interpol provided the
opportunity for real-time operational information exchange between the
countries. 
Within less than two weeks, the international cooperation
led to:
Arrest of 26 suspected
     people smugglers Detection of 2 760
     irregular migrants Detection of 92
     fraudulent documents Seizure of EUR 403 850
     in smuggled cash Seizure of 200 000
     cigarettes Detection of three
     firearms and 88 pieces of ammunition.
