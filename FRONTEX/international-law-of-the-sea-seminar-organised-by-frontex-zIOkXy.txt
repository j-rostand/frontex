On 10 December, Frontex organised a seminar on the challenges of common interpretation of the International Law of the Sea. The event was hosted by the Frontex Partnership Academy of the Guardia di Finanza in Gaeta, Italy.  Representatives of 22 Member States, European Commission, as well as UNHCR, IOM and UNODC were present at the event.  The outcome of the discussion noted the existing challenges and the need to develop common understandings on the provisions under the international law of the sea –as well as to predefine common procedures for search and rescue activities, including identification of places for disembarkation of rescued persons. The participants recognised that these challenges should not be addressed exclusively from the search and rescue perspective but also from the refugee protection point of view.  “A comprehensive approach to the challenges is necessary: immigration control, human rights, search and rescue, and the fight against organised crime are all important” concluded the chairman of the seminar Sakari Vuorensola, head of Frontex Legal Unit.
