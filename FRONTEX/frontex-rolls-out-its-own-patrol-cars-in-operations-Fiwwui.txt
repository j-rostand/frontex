For the first time in its history, Frontex, the European
Border and Coast Guard Agency, is starting to use its own patrol cars in its
various field deployments at Europe’s borders. 
The 16 new patrol cars, carrying the agency’s logo, mark a
leap forward in the agency’s efforts to develop a pool of its own equipment. In
the coming months the agency will start deploying vans that serve as mobile
offices for the registration of migrants. In the future it will also use its
own vessels, planes, remotely piloted aircraft and other equipment.
“Having our own equipment, starting with these all-terrain
cars carrying the logo of Frontex,
the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will help us  better protect the European Area of Freedom,
Security and Justice,” said Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
Until now Frontex has relied mainly on equipment from EU Member States and Schengen-associated countries. 
This will relieve the pressure on the Member States participating
in the agency’s activities and enable it to react faster to any developments at
the EU’s external border.
