An officer on a Swedish coastal patrol boat was injured on Monday
when the he tried to board a yacht near the island of Lesbos.The Swedish vessel, which is taking part in the
Frontex-coordinated Operation Poseidon Sea, conducted a border control
procedure in Greek coastal waters after the yacht ignored several commands to
stop its engine. Following several attempts to signal the yachts to stop, it
instead accelerated in the direction of Turkey. The Swedish CPB caught up with
the yacht, but during an attempt to board it a Swedish officer was jammed between
the two vessels. He was hospitalised after the incident with a bone fracture.Two other Swedish officers boarded the yacht and arrested
two people on board. The yacht was escorted to the port of Mytilene. Greek
authorities are investigating the case.
The Swedish CPB is one of the 16 vessels taking part in
Operation Poseidon Sea in Greece.
