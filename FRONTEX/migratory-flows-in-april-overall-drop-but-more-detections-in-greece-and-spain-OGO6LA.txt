In April, some 10 500 irregular border crossings were detected on the
 main migratory routes into the EU, down a third from the same month of 
last year.In the first four months of 2018, the total number of 
irregular border crossings dropped 44% compared to a year ago to about 
29 700, mainly because of lower migratory pressure on the Central 
Mediterranean route.
