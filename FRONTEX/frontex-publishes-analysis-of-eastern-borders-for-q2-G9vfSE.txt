Ukrainians accounted for the biggest share of the 1 400
illegal border crossings on the Europe’s eastern borders in the second quarter
of this year, but only 10 cases were related to irregular migration, according
to Frontex’s Eastern European Borders Quarterly report.
The rest of the illegal crossings by the citizens of Ukraine
were in large part linked to smuggling.
Ukrainians, Georgians, Moldovans and other citizens of the
CIS countries accounted for 47 percent of the illegal crossings. The remaining
53 percent of the detections involved nationals from outside the region,
especially citizens of Vietnam and Afghanistan.
Detections of illegal crossings between border crossing
points in the April-June period increased 82 percent from the previous quarter
and 74 percent from the same three-month period of 2014. Larger numbers of
Vietnamese and Afghan migrants accounted for the increase, while the number of
Syrian nationals fell from the first three months of the year.
