Frontex welcomed on Thursday the announcement by the
European Council that it would triple the funding for operations in the
Mediterranean Sea. The agency also thanks EU member states for their pledges to
provide additional vessels and aircraft to help avoid future tragedies at sea.
“I am glad to say that the number of pledged assets
surpassed our expectations. These assets will contribute to the significant
expansion of our operations in the Mediterranean Sea. We will increase our
efforts to prevent future tragedies,” Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri said.
In the coming days, Frontex will hold working level meetings
with the European Commission and authorities from affected member states to coordinate
operational upgrades.  Frontex representatives
will also meet with officials from the European External Action Service (EEAS) to
coordinate its actions with the possible Common Security and Defence Policy
(CSDP) operation.
