The total of 31 officers from 14 Member States participated in a joint operation coordinated by Frontex with the aim to tackle illegal migration of Moldovan nationals. During their deployment at several border crossing points and along the green border of Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, the task of the guest officers was to enhance border control and to assist local authorities to identify false/falsified document used by the nationals of Moldova. Besides the hosting countries, participating Member States included Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom.
As Frontex risk analysis had shown, one of the main nationalities in illegal border crossings in the eastern part of the European Union are Moldovans. Besides, an increase in this trend was expected with the accession of Romania to the EU and the resulting visa obligation for Moldovans to enter Romania.
During the two-week operation taking place in April 2007 the presence of guest officers enhanced the control of the border, enabled sharing of expertise among officers from several Member States and also contributed to gathering of information for the purpose of further activities. The total of 109 illegal border crossings or attempts were detected. The operation also included deployment of carbon dioxide detectors provided by the United Kingdom, used for detection of people hidden in vehicles. The use of falsified EU travel documents and the route via Romania and Hungary to Schengen countries were identified by Frontex as for the most frequent modus operandi.
