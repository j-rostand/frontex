Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri expressed sadness over the tragic deaths of
migrants in the Mediterranean this week and said that while the mandate of
Frontex is border control, the agency would continue to do its utmost to assist
the Italian authorities in the search and rescue operations to save migrants
stranded at sea. “I am deeply moved by this tragedy and outraged
at the smugglers who are willing to put the lives of hundreds of people at the
mercy of the rough seas. The 12-metre rubber dinghies with more than a hundred
people crammed aboard are no match for the massive waves nearly as high as a
three-story building,” Leggeri said. On Monday
night a rubber boat with 106 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa was rescued by
the Italian Coast Guard, which conducted a rescue operation 120 NM from
Lampedusa. Twenty-nine of the rescued migrants, including three minors, died of
hypothermia. Two of the four vessels that rescued the migrants 40 NM from
Tripoli are taking part in operation Triton.The
inflatable raft rescued on Monday was one of several that left a beach near
Tripoli on Saturday. At least 300 migrants are feared dead.Since the
launch of the Triton operation in November, Frontex helped to save 6,000 of the
19,000 migrants on their way to Italy.“When I was
in Sicily last week, I saw in person how dangerous the Mediterranean Sea can be
in the winter. Venturing out on small rubber boats in high winds and such low
temperatures puts all the people aboard in grave danger,” Leggeri said.
During his
first visit to EU external borders since taking office in January, Leggeri met last
week with the officers deployed in the Triton operation. He also visited a
reception centre in Pozzallo, where he observed a debriefing of migrants who
put their lives at risk to reach the Italian coast.
