Frontex
and the European Commission signed a delegation agreement today, providing
funding to the agency to implement satellite services dedicated to border
surveillance as part of the Copernicus programme.The
Commission will provide EUR 47.6 million to Frontex between 2015 and 2020 to support
the following services: coastal monitoring,
monitoring of international waters, reference mapping, maritime surveillance of
an area, vessel detection, vessel tracking and reporting, anomaly detection and
environmental assessment.Copernicus is a
European system for monitoring the Earth. It consists of a complex set of
systems which collect data from multiple sources: earth observation satellites,
along with ground stations, airborne and sea-borne sensors and other sensors. “The dedicated border surveillance service of
the security component of the Copernicus programme will improve the situational
awareness at the EU’s external borders and contribute to the detection of cross-border
crime. It has the potential to reduce the death toll of migrants at sea by
spotting vessels in need of assistance,” said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri.The data provided by
Copernicus would also support existing Frontex services.Frontex already
provides information collected from satellites and other surveillance tools at
the European level. Member states can use such information to further improve
their situational awareness. The collection of these services, called Eurosur
Fusion Services, facilitates access to state of the art technologies, help
reduce the duplication of efforts by member states and reduces costs.The Eurosur Fusion
Services include automated vessel tracking and detection capabilities, software functionalities allowing
complex calculations for detecting anomalies and predicting vessel positions,
as well as precise weather and oceanographic forecasts. Fusion Services use
optical and radar satellite technology to locate vessels requiring search and
rescue operations or those that are suspected of being engaged in criminal
activities, such as drug or weapon smuggling. Many of the services are
delivered in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and
the EU Satellite Centre (SatCen).The
Copernicus services address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere,
climate change, emergency management and security.
