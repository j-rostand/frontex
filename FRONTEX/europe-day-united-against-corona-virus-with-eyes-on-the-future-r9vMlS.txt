70 years after the Schuman declaration, Europe faces a
crisis which makes standing together more important than ever. Today we
remember how Europeans made history in 1950 and pay tribute to those who are currently
making history in the fight against COVID-19. “Seven decades ago
Robert Schuman set out his idea for a new form of cooperation in Europe, which
ultimately paved the way for the European Union. It is a momentous achievement
that today helps protect 446 million citizens of its Member States. We’re proud
to do our part by making Europe’s borders more secure,” said Fabrice Leggeri,
Executive Director of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.
The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need for
solidarity across Europe and the crucial role of the EU in coordinating the
European response. Such a response is essential when it comes to our borders. If
we cannot control the external borders, we cannot control the spread of pandemics
in Europe. 
Frontex plays a key role in ensuring effective protection of the external
borders of the European Union not only against cross-border crime but also
against health threats.
