Over the last three years, people smugglers have pocketed more
than EUR 330 million from their criminal operations on the Western and Central
Mediterranean migratory routes. And, with the shift in patterns of migration
across the Mediterranean, we have also noticed a change in how these criminal
groups are reaping their profits from the misery of migrants seeking to cross
the sea.
For a good part of the decade, it was the Central
Mediterranean where criminal groups were seeing massive earnings. In 2017 alone,
criminal networks smuggling migrants to Italy by boat generated nearly EUR 135
million in 2017, charging EUR 1 300 per person. In mid-2018, the smuggling fees
increased to EUR 1 800 per person, while the overall income of the smuggling
networks decreased to just over EUR 24 million in 2018, and to over EUR 12
million in 2019 due to a drop in the number of migrants.
Meanwhile, smuggling networks operating the Western
Mediterranean route saw their profits surge. While before migrants paid from
EUR 500 to EUR 1000 to be smuggled from Algeria to Spain, and EUR 1000 to EUR 2000
from Morocco to Spain, from mid-2018 the fees reached EUR 3000 per person. This
was in large part due to the fact that Sub-Saharan migrants, who usually pay
larger amounts of money to smugglers, saw the Western Mediterranean as an
alternative to the Central Mediterranean route. Those from West Africa started
travelling to Algeria and Morocco, via Mali and Mauritania, and then further to
Spain by boat.
