This week, Frontex
invited the top officials from airports around Europe to Venice,
Italy, to discuss maintaining high border control standards at EU
airports amid the rapidly growing numbers of travellers.

As millions of travellers take to the sky each year, effective
exchange of information and the use of the newest border management
tools such as biometrics on the move are essential to maintain the
freedom of movement within the EU, while ensuring the safety of its
external borders.
“Europe is only as
secure as its outside borders. Maintaining our freedom of movement
and the further development of our economies has to go hand in hand
with efficient and modern border control. With this conference we
want to enhance integrated border management at European airports,
making sure that the rise in air travel does not negatively affect
border security and the comfort of travellers,” said Frontex Deputy
Executive Director Berndt Koerner.
