On 26 March 2009, Frontex representatives attended a LIMES end Users engagement Workshop in Paris. LIMES (Land and Sea Monitoring for Environment and Security) is an Integrated Project co-funded by the European Commission within the 6° Framework Programme –Aeronautics&Space/GMES Security. It has started on December 1st, 2006 aiming to develop security applications and services based on Earth Observation systems, satellite communications and positioning technologies. 
Maritime Surveillance Services are developed with the objective of improving the monitoring of both vessel and cargo movements. The Services provide Earth Observation based vessel detection products to improve the awareness of maritime illegal trafficking approaching the coastline and perform optimum planning of coastal zones patrolling missions. These services are based on satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar include the integration of other monitoring systems, such as VTS, VMS, AIS. 
As part of the Frontex Joint Operation Nautilus 2008 an evaluation of the viability of using satellite images for maritime surveillance was conducted.
Land and Infrastructure Surveillance Services are developed on the capacity of Very High Resolution satellites, used in conjunction with medium to high resolution data and aerial imagery, to enable spatial analysis for assessing risks, improving security and enhancing preparedness. The Services envision the monitoring of national borders and critical infrastructures, the support to large event planning and to non-proliferation treaties monitoring. 
The demonstration and validation of land border monitoring and adoption of satellite observation techniques combined with the use of specific analytical tools to monitor borderline areas was focused on part of the eastern EU border and done in close cooperation with the Polish Border Guard.
