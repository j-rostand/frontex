Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri has called on EU Member States to come forward with additional
police officers and readmission experts to support Greece in returning migrants
to Turkey.
Following a call for officers
issued by Frontex on Friday, 18 March, Member States have so far offered 396
police officers of the 1500 requested. Frontex has also received offers to
provide 47 of the 50 readmission experts the agency asked for.
“I am grateful to the
countries who have offered police officers to assist in the escorting of
migrants. We have almost reached the target for readmission experts. But I urge
other Member States to pledge many more police officers if we want to be ready
to support readmission to Turkey as agreed by the EU Council,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
Frontex has shared with the
Greek authorities the updated operational plan for Poseidon Rapid Intervention.
It will be ready before the deadline at the end of this week. Frontex has also
prepared a special training package for the escort officers.
The readmission operations
will proceed in full compliance with EU and international law, as well as the
principle of non-refoulement.
All of the officers will be
seconded to Frontex from the authorities of Member States for a temporary
period.
