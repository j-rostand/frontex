The Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC) Joint Report 2016 analyses the irregular migratory movements affecting AFIC countries and EU Member States, cross-border criminality and provides an overview of the main regional security threats affecting the countries in the community. The report also presents a picture of the smuggling networks in Africa.The city of Agadez in Niger remained the key transit hub for migratory movements towards Libya with many networks facilitating onward movements operating there. The networks are based on a hierarchical structure with the so-called ghetto boss at the top. He owns one or more compounds where migrants are lodged, as well as a number of vehicles (either stolen or purchased) – typically pickups and military-style cargo trucks from Libya. These are used in convoys to transport the migrants to southern Libya.Mali continues to serve as an alternative transit point for migrants, who tend to pass through the city of Gao. Another important transit hub is Sudan’s capital of Khartoum, which is mostly used by Somalis and Eritreans.The AFIC was set up in 2010 to provide a framework for regular knowledge and intelligence sharing in the field of border security between Frontex and African countries.
