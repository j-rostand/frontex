The Joint Operation Nautilus 2008 received a green light after the agreement between participating Member States has been reached on Wednesday in Frontex headquarters. 
 
The mission was on hold due to the difference of opinion concerning the responsibility of migrants saved at sea. After discussions rules regarding the disembarkation of persons rescued at sea during the operation will remain the same as in last year’s operation. Migrants saved in the Libyan Search and Rescue Area (SAR) will be taken to Libya, when not possible to closest safe haven. 
 
The main aim of the Nautilus 2008 is to strengthen the control of the Central Mediterranean maritime border using means of several Member States and support Maltese authorities in interviews with immigrants. Now, when all the details of operational plan have been agreed upon the operation is due to start in the coming days.
