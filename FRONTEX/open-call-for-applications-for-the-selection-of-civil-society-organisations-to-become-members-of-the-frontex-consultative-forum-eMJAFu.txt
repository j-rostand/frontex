Pursuant to Article 70 of the European Border and Coast
Guard Regulation, Frontex established a Consultative
Forum on Fundamental Rights. The tasks of the Consultative Forum are
to assist the Executive Director and the Management Board with independent
advice in fundamental rights matters. 
The current Forum is composed of 15
members and headed by two chairs elected by its members for a specific
term.
The work of the Consultative Forum is undertaken in a spirit of
transparency, mutual respect, informed participation and collegiality.
Following the expiry of the mandate of the current
Consultative Forum members on 31st December 2019, the Frontex
Management Board decided to launch a public call for applications for civil
society organisations. The civil society organisations will be selected on the
basis of eligibility and selection criteria. 
If your organisation is interested in becoming a member of the Consultative
Forum, please read carefully the open call for applications and send a
completed Application Form together with supporting documentation to registration@frontex.europa.eu
indicating as subject: CF Application
by Friday, 8 November 2019 (midday, 12:00 h of
Warsaw local time).
