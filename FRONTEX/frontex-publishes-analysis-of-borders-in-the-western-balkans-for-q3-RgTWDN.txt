More than 610 000 illegal border crossings by migrants from
outside the region were reported at the Western Balkan common and regional
borders in the third quarter of 2015. This was more than twice the total number
of such detections in the region since data collection began six and a half
years ago (between January 2009 and June 2015).Syrians and Afghans, who had originally entered the Eu in Greece,
continued to be the two main nationalities reported crossing the borders in the
Western Balkans. They were followed by Iraqis and Pakistanis. The number of
African migrants detected in the region in the third quarter rose by nearly 40%
from the previous three-month period.
Most migrants who crossed the EUâ€™s borders in the Western
Balkans had earlier landed on one of the Greek islands before continuing
northwards through the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia.
