Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri will meet with
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos
on Monday in Brussels to discuss the coordination of their activities related to the refugee
and migrant crisis.This meeting will take place after NATO decided on Thursday
to launch an operation near Turkey.Frontex currently has 775 officers and support staff
deployed on the Greek islands as part of Poseidon Rapid Intervention. The operation
also includes 15 vessels patrolling the areas most affected by the migration
flows. “We will work closely
with NATO and its members to cooperate in doing all we can to combat the criminals
making billions of euros from smuggling desperate people from Turkey to Greece,”
said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
“Of course, we’ll make sure that all our actions will
continue to respect the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,” Leggeri added.
