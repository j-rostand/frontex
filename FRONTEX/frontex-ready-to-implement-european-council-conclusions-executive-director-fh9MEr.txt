Frontex is looking forward to implement the
conclusions of the European Council to be held this afternoon in Brussels and
has already started preparing the implementation of the Home Affairs/Foreign
Affairs Council held in Luxemburg on Monday, 20 April, Frontex Executive
Director Fabrice Leggeri said.“My proposal is to increase as an immediate
step air surveillance in the Mediterranean Sea south of Italy and Malta in
addition to the vessels currently deployed, which is aimed at enhancing search
and rescue capacities in the area,” Leggeri said.Leggeri has suggested increasing the aerial
assets taking part in the Frontex-coordinated Triton operation also following
two incidents when people smugglers have used weapons to reclaim boats
following search and rescue operations in which vessels taking part in Triton
were involved. 
“Assets co-funded by the agency have helped
save thousands of lives in the Mediterranean. Frontex will continue within its
mandate to do everything it can to fulfil this responsibility,”Leggeri said.
