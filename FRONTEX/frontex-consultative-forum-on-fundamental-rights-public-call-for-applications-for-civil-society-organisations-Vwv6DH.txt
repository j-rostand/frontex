Pursuant to Article 26a (2) of the amended Frontex Regulation, Frontex shall establish a Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights (CF), a knowledge and expertise resource body to enable the Agency to gain information and advice relevant to the aim of developing and promoting the full respect of Fundamental Rights in all the Agencyâ€™s activities.

In order to guarantee transparency and the opportunity of participation in the CF to the widest possible group of stakeholders, the members of the CF belonging to Civil Society organisations will be selected following a public call for applications and on the basis of pre-defined eligibility and selection criteria.

If your organisation is interested in becoming a member of the CF, please read carefully the Background Note for the Public Call for Applications and send a completed Application Form together with supporting documentation to consultative.forum@frontex.europa.eu by 25 June 2012.
