Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will play a 
central role in implementing the regulation governing the European 
Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which came into 
force on 9 October. ETIAS is a system for granting 
authorisation to travellers who do not need a visa to visit the Schengen
 area. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency will set up and manage
 the ETIAS Central Unit, which will provide operational support, as well
 as reinforcing and coordinating border control activities in Member 
States.
