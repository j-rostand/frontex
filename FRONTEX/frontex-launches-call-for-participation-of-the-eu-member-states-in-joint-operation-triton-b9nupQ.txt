Frontex
concluded talks with the Italian authorities on September 24 concerning the
launch of a new joint operation in Italy.Due
to the extremely high migratory pressure Italy is currently subject to, Frontex
will launch a new operation in the Central Mediterranean area. Codenamed Triton, the operation will cover the maritime
area south of Sicily and the Pelagic islands as well as the coastal areas around
Calabria, southern Italy. Having
defined the technical requirements, Frontex has sent a request to all member
states of the European Union to contribute the necessary equipment — including
aircraft and a variety of patrol vessels — to support the Italian authorities
in border-control activities in the Mediterranean.Frontex
will also contact the European Commission with a request for funding of the
operation. 
While
saving lives is an absolute priority in in all maritime operations coordinated
by Frontex, the focus of Joint Operation Triton will be primarily border
management.
