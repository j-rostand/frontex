Frontex hosted 600 European border and coast guard 
representatives from more than 30 countries at the annual European 
Border and Coast Guard Day. The Agency’s flagship event took place this 
year in Arlamow, near Poland’s external border
 with Ukraine. “Today we celebrate the work of border guards at 
the land borders and we highlight cooperation with our partners outside 
the European Union, such as Ukraine,” said Frontex Executive Director 
Fabrice Leggeri.This year’s event was especially focused on the 
challenges at land external borders and on how cooperation with the 
neighbouring countries, modern means of surveillance and large-scale IT 
systems such as EES (Entry-Exit System) and ETIAS
 (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) allow to tackle 
them. The event also included a land border exercise conducted by Polish
 Border Guard’s Bieszczadzki Regional Unit.
The European Border and Coast Guard Agency’s annual
 event touched upon some key topics that will be central for the border 
and coast guard community in the months ahead, ranging from the 
implementation of the new regulation including the
 development of a standing corps up to challenges related to the 
Agency’s role in the implementation of large-scale IT systems such as 
the EES and ETIAS in close cooperation with Member States.
