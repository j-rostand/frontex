The body of 17-year old Iraqi boy was found
after a shooting incident aboard a yacht carrying around 70 migrants near the
Greek island of Symi on Saturday.  The
incident took place after a Latvian patrol vessel deployed in operation
Poseidon Sea detected the yacht on early Saturday afternoon in Symi Island’s
Marathounta Bay. Upon
detection by the Latvian vessel, the yacht changed course and began heading for
Turkey, ignoring all signals to stop. When approached, it tried to ram the
Latvian vessel. With the help of the Hellenic Coast Guard that arrived on the
spot, the yacht was stopped and Greek officers boarded the vessel while the
Latvian patrol vessel remained at a distance.  Aboard, the skipper of the yacht attacked the Greek
officers, injuring one of them.  During
the incident, shots were fired.  One of
the smugglers was also injured.  Later a
body of the 17-year-old was discovered aboard. The body was immediately taken
to a hospital on the island of Rhodes for an autopsy. 
Operation Poseidon Sea is carried out at
the sea border between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea. Frontex supports
Greek authorities by deploying a number of vessels, aircraft, helicopters and thermal
vision vehicles from over 10 EU/Schengen member states.  Since the beginning of the year, more than 179
000 migrants arrived in the Aegean islands from Turkey.
