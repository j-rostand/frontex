Today, Frontex hosted the opening ceremony for the Joint
Master’s in Strategic Border Management programme, Europe’s only such specialised
degree. It was developed by the agency, in collaboration with six partner
universities and more than 20 EU border guard training organisations and
academies.The Joint Master’s programme reflects one of Frontex’s core commitments
to support training and professional education of national border guards by
establishing common training standards at the European level. The 27 participants of the Joint Master’s programme come
from agencies with border security responsibility from EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries. Over the next 18 months, they will cover topics
such as fundamental rights, risk and threat management and innovation and
technology related to border management at universities and training academies
in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Spain. “At a time when the EU faces unprecedented challenges at its
borders, this programme creates a unique opportunity for the current and future
leaders of border guard organisations to work and learn together,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.“At the end of this learning experience, each
participant will be rewarded with a unique Master’s degree in Strategic Border
Management,” Leggeri added. The first group of participants will receive their degrees in June 2017.The Joint Master’s programme aims to promote
interoperability and the highest standards at EU borders, while protecting and
promoting fundamental rights in border management. It empowers European border
guard managers to rely on and apply professional judgment by developing the
skills acquired through problem-solving in a professional context.“From the European perspective, this programme is a highly
cost-effective investment. It helps streamline the high level professional
education initiatives, reduce costs and avoid overlaps, duplications and
inconsistencies in training,” said Beatrice Comby, the head of the Capacity
Building Division at Frontex.
Frontex, the European agency for the coordination of
operations at the external borders of the EU, marks its 10th
anniversary this year.
