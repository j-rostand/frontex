Warsaw, March 03, 2011—Frontex signed Framework Training Agreements with five new border guard academies and universities on March 3, in a ceremony held at the German Federal Police Academy in Lübeck. The five institutions joining Frontex Network of Partnership Academies all come from Member States not previously represented — Estonia, France, Malta, Poland and Spain — bringing the number of Partnership Academies to 15 in 14 Member States. Two more academies from Hungary and Slovenia are about to join the network in the near future. The expansion of the network will facilitate even closer collaboration between the Member States and Frontex. It will contribute to the improvement and harmonisation of the training and education standards of European border guards as the Partnership Academies will play a significant role in the development and implementation of common training standards developed by Frontex Training Unit.  Frontex uses Partnership Academies to organise a high number of training activities – close to 200 in 2010 – in order to maximise its reach to European border guards. Since 2005, the Partnership Academies have provided physical facilities and logistical services to enable border guard courses, meetings, workshops and other training events. The institutions already participating in the Partnership Academies network were law enforcement academies and universities in: Gaeta and Cesena (Italy), Helsinki (Finland), Bratislava (Slovakia), Traiskirchen (Austria), Iasi (Romania), Vilnius (Lithuania), Luebeck (Germany),  Gatwick (United Kingdom) and Apeldoorn (The Netherlands).
