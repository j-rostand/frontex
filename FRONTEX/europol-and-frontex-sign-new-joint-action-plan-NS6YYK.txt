Efforts of both agencies in the fields of research and development of new technologies will also be closely coordinated, for instance for the introduction of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). Frontex will set up and manage the ETIAS Central Unit, which will provide operational support, as well as reinforcing and coordinating border control activities in Member States.Europol and Frontex also plan to hold annual meetings of executive management and exchange liaison officers.
