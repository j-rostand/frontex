Frontex,
in association with the Academy of European Law (ERA) is pleased to announce
the upcoming conference “The Feasibility of a European System of Border Guards
(ESBG): A Practitioners Perspective.” The event will be held in Warsaw between
the 28-29th October, 2013 and will gather together various agency
and departmental stakeholders as well as representatives from national border
authorities across Europe. Together, they will debate the merits such a system
would entail as well as its practical/legal obstacles.The
feasibility of the creation of a European System of Border Guards (ESBG), as
indicated in the Stockholm Programme, is closely linked to the debate on the
long-term development of Frontex and, as such, will influence its future as an
EU Agency. This conference aims to provide input to the debate on the
feasibility of a European System of Border Guards by looking, from a
practitioner’s point of view, at the added value that such a system could
bring. By focusing the discussion around different aspects such as the legal
framework, the operational challenges, the necessary capacities as well as
interagency cooperation - different stakeholders will be able to provide their
views on the feasibility of an ESBG, notably which gaps it would fill, and
what shape it should take - if any. Key Topics to be discussed:Legal
perspectives and possibilities under the Treaty of Lisbon for an ESBG.Options for
enhanced operational coordination and integration of national border control
operations.A more European
approach in the development of national border management capacities.Integrated
Border Management (IBM) with a focus on new avenues for cooperation with other
agencies and bodies that would ensure more efficient cooperation at the EU’s
external borders.
