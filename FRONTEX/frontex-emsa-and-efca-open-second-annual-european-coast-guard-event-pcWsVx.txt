On 16 April, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri opened the annual European Coast Guard Event in Świnoujście, Poland.
This is the second such event jointly organised by Frontex, the European
Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).
The Annual Coast Guard Event
provides a platform for national authorities, the EU agencies involved in the
cooperation on coast guard functions and the European Commission to exchange
views on matters related to safety and security at sea. The discussions focused
on information sharing and surveillance, analysing risks at sea and training of
coast guard officers. 
 “Our
annual gathering highlights the growing cooperation on European coast guard
functions,” said Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri.
“I would like to point out that our three agencies are working together
as partners to provide increased operational support to the national
authorities working at sea. This event allows us to talk about what we have
already achieved, what we plan to do and how we can improve maritime safety and
security together,” he added.
