This week Frontex marks its two-year anniversary as
the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Over the last two years the agency
has cemented its position as one of the cornerstones of the EU’s area of
freedom, security and justice, becoming more and more operational on the ground
at Europe’s external borders.
More operational
and more involved on the ground
Currently the agency deploys some 1500 officers on
average in its numerous operations at EU’s external borders and over the last
two years has doubled the number of its staff to more than 600. Twenty six
ships are also taking part in its operations, along with six airplanes, four
helicopters and numerous vehicles, including 80 patrol cars. 
“I am proud to say
that over the last two years Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, was able to deliver. We have become one of the most dynamic EU agencies
with an extended mandate, more responsibilities and a larger staff. We are now
on the front line of border management, including combatting organised crime.
The bottom line is that Europe is only as secure as its external borders,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
