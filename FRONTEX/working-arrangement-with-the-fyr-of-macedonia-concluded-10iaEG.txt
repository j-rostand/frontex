Ths Working Arrangement between Frontex and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia entered into force on 20 January 2009. This is yet another working arrangement signed by the Agency with a neighbouring country. Close cooperation with third countries is one of the core elements of the EU Integrated Border Management that is being implemented by the Agency. 
Cooperation between Frontex and the MIA will be developed gradually from information exchange and risk analysis, through common training and R&D projects, to joint operational measures. The enhancement of cooperation in the field of risk analysis will be the first step to enact the agreement. As a matter of fact the fYROM authorities have already taken part in some of the activities of the Frontex Risk Analysis Unit focused on the Western Balkans. 
So far Frontex has formalised the cooperation with law enforcement authorities of six countries including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Croatia, Moldova, Georgia and the fYR of Macedonia. Negotiations with another thirteen are ongoing.
