A preparatory meeting of Frontex’s Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights (CF) was held in Warsaw yesterday.Participants in the meeting discussed how the CF could assist Frontex in promoting the respect of fundamental rights in all its activities and what the working methods of the forum should be. 
The meeting gathered representatives of 15 organisations specialized in different aspects of human rights, but all having expertise in migration issues. 
Yesterday’s meeting was one of the last steps leading to a formal decision on setting up this consultative process with civil society and international organisations. The Management Board will approve the list of the CF members and the working methods at its session on the 27th of September. 
Once the formal decision is made, the Consultative Forum will be able to start its work. Its first plenary meeting is foreseen for October 2012.
The establishment of the Consultative Forum is stipulated in the amended Frontex regulation that entered into force December 2011. The Consultative Forum has the task of assisting the Executive Director (ED) and the MB in fundamental rights matters and is to be consulted on the further development and implementation of the Frontex Fundamental Rights Strategy, Code of Conduct and Common Core Curriculum.
