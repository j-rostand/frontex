If you’re passing through the Lisbon airport this month, you
could experience the future of border control as you leave the European Union.
Instead of standing in queue to show your passport to border guard, travellers
are able to cross the border almost seamlessly thanks to face recognition and
touchless scanning of fingerprints.
We call this “Biometrics on the Move” technology and in the
coming days, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will be
testing it together with Border Service of Portugal (SEF) and the Lisbon
Airport Authority (ANA). 
Biometrics on the Move will make it easier for travellers to
quickly pass through border checks without even taking out their passport or
other documents. It is part of our mission to make crossing the border easier
and more secure at the same time.
This technology will give border guards more time to conduct
systematic and efficient security checks without affecting regular travellers,
increasing security at the borders. 
The trial at the Lisbon airport, which covers EU citizens
leaving the Schengen Area, will test whether biometric solutions can decrease
the waiting time at the borders.
