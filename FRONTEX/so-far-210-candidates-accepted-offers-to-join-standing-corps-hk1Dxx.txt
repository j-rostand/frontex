More than 210 candidates have already accepted their offers to become the first officers to join the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps, the first uniformed law enforcement service of the European Union. This accounts for three-quarters of the 280 candidates who
received job offers from Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency,
last week. Those who have accepted will begin their online training in mid-June
and will take part in a physical training programme later this year. It will
ensure that the officers have the necessary skills to work together in any particular
operational area, fully complying with the applicable EU law and ethical
standards.

The first group of selected candidates has until the middle
of this week to accept the job offers. The standing corps will be composed of Frontex and EU Member
Statesâ€™ officers, who will at any time be able to support the Member States
facing challenges at their external borders.

The agency received 7 500 applications from candidates
interested in becoming Frontex border guards. It is continuing the selection
procedure for other candidates who may also be offered a position in the
standing corps later this year after completing all the stages of the
recruitment process, which includes an interview, English exam and physical
aptitude test. Those who will be selected will also undergo a six-month
training programme before participating in operational activities.
Since the end of April, Frontex has been conducting online
interviews with the remaining candidates. So far, it has interviewed nearly a
third of the eligible candidates.
