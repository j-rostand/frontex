On 25 November 2008 a training tool for European Border Guards was launched. The tool is an interactive CD Rom consisting of two parts – informative and educational.
While the former includes comprehensive information about EU borders, border crossing points, border guard services, their history and structure in each of the 27 EU member States (as well as in the two Schengen Associate countries), the latter consists of an eight - hour-long training of the EU border guards in detection of forged and falsified documents.
Jointly developed by high-level experts in false document detection from 15 EU border guard authorities, this advanced training targets specifically first-line border guards.
The tool complements the existing training which is part of the Common Core Curriculum – a standardised general training for all European Border Guard Officers.
