In
the first quarter of this year, FRAN indicators on illegal border-crossing
between border crossing points (BCPs), illegal stay and asylum eased after
reaching record levels in the fourth quarter of 2015. Irregular migration
pressure steadily decreased between January and March 2016, although it was
still higher than in any previous first quarter since the FRAN data collection
began in 2007.
