In March, 6
200 irregular border crossings were detected on the four main migratory routes
into the EU, down 63% from the same month of last year.
In the first
quarter of 2018, the total number of irregular border crossings halved to 18
800, mainly because of lower migratory pressure on the Central Mediterranean
route. 

Central
Mediterranean
The number
of migrants arriving in Italy via the Central Mediterranean route in March fell
to below 1 400, down 88% than in the same month of 2017. The total number of
migrants detected on this route in the first three months of 2018 fell to
roughly 6 600. The drop represents a plunge of nearly three-quarters compared
to a year ago.
So far this
year, Eritreans have been the largest group on this route, accounting for one
of every four detected migrants. They were followed by nationals of Tunisia,
who departed from their home country. 

Eastern
Mediterranean
In March,
the number of irregular migrants taking the Eastern Mediterranean route, mainly
reaching the Greek islands, stood at 3 700, 13% fewer than in the year-ago
period. In the first quarter of this year, more than 7 900 migrants entered the
EU through the Eastern Mediterranean route, 30% more than in the same period of
2017. The increase was mainly caused a rise of irregular crossings on the land
borders with Turkey.
The largest
number of migrants on this route in the first three months of the year were
nationals of Syria and Iraq.
