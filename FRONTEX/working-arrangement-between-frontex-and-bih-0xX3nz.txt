On 3 April 2009 Minister of Security, Tarik Sadović and the Executive Director of Frontex, Ilkka Laitinen signed the working arrangement between Frontex and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 “Frontex is pleased to sign the working arrangement and looks forward to the positive implementation of the operational cooperation with the Ministry of Security and Border Police” – said Frontex Executive Director. 
 Having had no previous experience of marinating an international border control as part of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina has come a long way in just a few years while establishing completely new border management structures. 
 The cooperation between Frontex, Ministry of Security and Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be developed gradually. The cooperation will focus on joint operational activities in the field of border control, training, as well as technical cooperation in the field of research and development. 
The joint efforts will improve security in the region and at the external borders of the EU and help combat cross-border crime.
