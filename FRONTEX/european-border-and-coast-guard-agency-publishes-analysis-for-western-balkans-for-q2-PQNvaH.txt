In the second
quarter of this year, the number of migrants detected at the borders of Western
Balkan countries plunged 88% from the previous three months to 26 488. The
figure is slightly higher than in the first quarter of 2015, before the region
experienced a massive increase in migrants who had previously arrived on the
Greek islands from Turkey. Afghans became the top reported nationality,
accounting for a 36% share of the total non-regional migration flow, while
Syrians dropped to the second place with 16%.
Meanwhile, in
the April-June period the number of people smugglers arrested increased by
nearly a fifth from the first quarter to 307.
