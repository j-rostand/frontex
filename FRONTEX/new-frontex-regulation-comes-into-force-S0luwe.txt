Today, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, is gaining new responsibilities and tools to more effectively support EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries in managing their external borders to provide a high level of security for all their citizens.The new European Border and Coast Guard regulation that is coming into force today paves the way for the creation of Europeâ€™s first uniformed service. Soon, Frontex will count on 10 000 border and coast guard officers to assist national authorities with border control and migration management.
