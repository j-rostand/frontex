More than 500 000 migrants were detected at EU external borders in
the first eight months of this year after a fifth consecutive monthly record
was registered in August when 156 000 crossed the EU borders. However, a large number of the persons detected at the
Hungarian border with Serbia had already been counted when they arrived in
Greece from Turkey a few weeks earlier.By comparison, in the entire 2014, there were 280 000
detections at EU borders.The Greek islands again saw the biggest number of detections
in August at 88 000, an 11-fold rise compared to the same month last year. Nearly
three-quarters of the people arriving from Turkey were Syrians.“The Greek islands continue to be under an intense migratory
pressure. Just last week Frontex offered additional staff to help identify and
register the new arrivals on Lesbos and Kos, which have been particularly affected,”
said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.The migrants arriving from Turkey speak about increasingly
aggressive and cruel smugglers, who ignore worsening weather conditions and force
migrants on overcrowded rubber boats to squeeze a bigger profit out of every
trip. A large number of the migrants arriving in Greece make their
way towards Hungary, where the number of detections at its border with Serbia increased
20-fold to more than 52 000 in August, bringing the number so far this year to
more than 155 000.Italy detected nearly 13 000 migrants in the month of August,
nearly half the number from the same month of last year. These were mainly people
from Eritrea and a number of Sub-Saharan countries who arrived from Libya,
although an increasing number of them departed Turkey.
Since the beginning of the year, 106 000 migrants were
rescued in the Central Mediterranean, 6 percent fewer than in the same period
of last year. It is important to note that most of the rescues took place
closer to the Libyan coast than to the EU sea borders.
