Today Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, launched a
series of training courses for border guards on automated border control (ABC).
This technology is complementary to a manual border control process and is
based on the use of electronic travel document and biometrics to verify the
authenticity of the document and passenger’s identity in an automated way, that
is to verify if a traveller is the one
whom he/she claims to be. ABC systems
are already extensively used at airports in 16 EU member states and are
expanding to other type of borders.
