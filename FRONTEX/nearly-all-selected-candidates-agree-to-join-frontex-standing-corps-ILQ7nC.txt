265 candidates from 21 EU Member States have accepted offers to become the first officers of the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps, the first uniformed law enforcement service of the European Union.This accounts for 94% of all the candidates who received
job offers from Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, last week.
The new recruits will begin their online training in mid-June and will take part in a
physical training programme later this year.
It will ensure that the officers have the necessary skills
to work together in any particular operational area, fully complying with the
applicable EU law and ethical standards.
“The incredible
response from the candidates who quickly accepted the job offers shows how
eager they are to become the first to join Frontex as members of the European
Border and Coast Guard Agency,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri.
“The unexpected
emergencies we all have been dealing with in recent months, like COVID-19 and
the situation at the Greek borders, only highlight the fact that Europe needs
Frontex and the standing corps to provide coordinated, unified assistance to
EU Member States at their external borders,” he added.
