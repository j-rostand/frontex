People smugglers fired several shots on Monday to recover a
wooden boat after the migrants it was carrying were rescued some 60 NM from
Libya. The search and rescue operation was carried out by an Italian tugboat
and Icelandic Coast Guard vessel Týr deployed
by Frontex.Týr, already
carrying 342 migrants from an earlier rescue operation, was called to assist the
tugboat in another rescue. After most of the 250 people aboard the second
migrant vessel were transferred to the tugboat, a speedboat approached. Its
crew fired several shots into the air and then assailants sped away with the
empty migrant boat.This is the second time this year when armed smugglers took
back a vessel used to transport migrants following a rescue operation in the
Central Mediterranean.“This is a sign that smugglers in Libya are running short of
boats and are more willing to use weapons to recover those used to transport
the migrants,” said Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex Executive Director. Týr and all the
other vessels and aircraft taking part in the Frontex-coordinated Joint
Operation Triton have been continuously assisting the Italian authorities in
the rescue of around 7 500 migrants since Friday. Eleven bodies of migrants
were recovered, including nine from one capsized boat. Nearly all of the
operations took place between 12 and 60 NM from the Libyan coast.The migrants rescued in recent days mainly originated from
countries in the Horn of Africa, Sub Sahara and West Africa. 
 “Over the last few
days, all vessels and aircraft involved in the Frontex-coordinated Joint
Operation Triton have taken part in the rescue operations. I would like to thank
the officers deployed in operation Triton for their commitment to saving
lives,” said Leggeri.
