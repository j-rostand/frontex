Three FRAN indicators – detections of illegal
border-crossing between border crossing points, detections of illegal stay and
asylum applications – surged in the third quarter of 2015 to reach their
highest levels ever recorded. This was in large part related to the
unprecedented number of migrants arriving on the Greek islands in 2015.
The vast majority of detections of illegal border-crossing
were made on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkan routes. Most of the
people who had entered the EU through one of the Greek islands were recorded
for the second time when they passed through the Western Balkans, re-entering
the EU across the Serbia-Croatia border.
Meanwhile, the number of migrants using the Central
Mediterranean route in the third quarter fell by nearly a fifth. However, while
the number of Syrians using this route dropped considerably, detections of many
African nationalities, including Nigerians and Somalis, were substantially
higher than in the same period of 2014.
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the Frontex Risk
Analysis Unit to provide a regular overview of irregular migration at the EU
external borders, based on the irregular migration data exchanged among Member
State border-control authorities.
