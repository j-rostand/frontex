Frontex-deployed
Norwegian vessel Siem Pilot helped rescue 487 of the 1200 people saved in the
Central Mediterranean Sea over the weekend. 

175 women
and 15 children were among the migrants. The vessel will disembark in Reggio di
Calabria tomorrow.
Siem Pilot
was involved in five different search and rescue operations over the last
weekend. The vessel is deployed in Italy as part in the Frontex-coordinated
Operation Triton. The migrants, most of them from Nigeria, made distress calls
to the Italian authorities shortly after leaving the Libyan coast. Most of them
travelled on small and heavily overcrowded rubber boats.

Since the
beginning of the year, 106 000 migrants were rescued in the Central
Mediterranean, 6 percent fewer than in the same period of last year.
