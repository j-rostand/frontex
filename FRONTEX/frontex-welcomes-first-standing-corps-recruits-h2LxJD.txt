Yesterday Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, welcomed 265 recruits who begin a six-month training programme to
become the first officers of the European Border and Coast Guard standing
corps.
“I am proud to welcome our new colleagues at Frontex. But
they are much more than new staff. They are on their way to becoming the first
officers of the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps, the pioneers of
the first uniformed law enforcement service of the European Union,” said
Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
Following a brief online induction, the first recruits will begin
a six-month basic training programme. Because of travel and other restrictions
related to the covid pandemic, the first part of the training will take place
online, followed-up by a second part in Member States Training Centres. This
will ensure that the officers have the necessary skills to work together in any
particular operational area, fully complying with the applicable EU law and
ethical standards.
The new Frontex border and coast guard officers are expected
to complete their training in December and be deployed at Europe’s external borders
starting in January 2021.
Frontex received 7 500 applications from candidates
interested in becoming its border guards. It is continuing the selection
procedure for other candidates who may also be offered a position in the
standing corps and start their six-month training later this year after
completing all the stages of the recruitment process, which includes an
interview, English exam and physical aptitude test.
