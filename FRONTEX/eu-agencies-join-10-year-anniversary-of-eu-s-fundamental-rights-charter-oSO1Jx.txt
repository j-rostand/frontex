The nine EU Justice and Home Affairs
Agencies are marking the 10-year anniversary of the EU’s Charter of
Fundamental Rights by pledging to continue to
promote and protect fundamental rights throughout their work. This
includes ensuring their work always complies with the Charter.
They will continue to uphold
fundamental rights in their working practices such as promoting
gender equality and diversity at work.
They will also run awareness raising
activities, staff training, joint activities to increase awareness
about the Charter and its entitlements.
In addition, they will continue to
build and enhance their capacity to respect the Charter by sharing
and exchanging best practices. This will form part of their regular
network meetings of Justice and Home Affairs Agencies, chaired this
year by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation
(Europol). 

The nine agencies are
the: European Union
Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in
the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA); European Asylum
Support Office (EASO); European
Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex); European
Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE); European Union Agency for
Fundamental Rights (FRA); European Union Agency for Law
Enforcement Cooperation (Europol);
