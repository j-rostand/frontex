In October, the number of detections of
illegal border crossings on Europeâ€™s main migratory routes fell 17%
from the previous month to around 16 800 due to a drop in arrivals on
the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. The total on all European
migratory routes for the first 10 months of 2019 was 16% lower at 107
900.
Eastern MediterraneanEven though the number of irregular
migrants taking the Eastern Mediterranean route in October fell 18%
from September to nearly 10 800*, it still accounted for two-thirds
of all the detections of illegal border crossings into the European
Union.
Despite the
slowdown last month in large part due to worse weather conditions,
the total number of detections in this region in the first 10 months
of this year was 31% higher than a year ago at nearly 63 000. 

In 2019 on the Eastern Mediterranean
route, Afghans accounted for nearly one of every three migrants
detected, while Syrians accounted for another quarter of the
irregular migrants.
