 Warsaw, May 20, 2011 — Today early morning migrant smugglers opened fire on a border patrol team deployed within the framework of Poseidon 2011 Joint Operation (JO) to the Evros Region (border between Greece and Turkey). No one was injured.
Border patrol alerted by an Estonian airplane deployed to this operational area prevented the illegal border crossing of a group of migrants facilitated by smugglers. After smugglers opened fire on Greek and German officers, Hellenic Police contacted their Turkish partners. The Turkish authorities informed later that almost 100 persons were apprehended."This case shows that facilitators have no scruples. They open fire on border guards, they expose migrants’ life to danger sending them to the open seas” said Ilkka Laitinen, Frontex Executive Director. “Luckily no one was injured today. Border guards’ work is not easy but with well-trained staff and proper equipment in place EU is able to fight against criminals exploiting migrants. Our colleagues from Greece, Germany and Estonia have shown today that they can work hand in hand in different, often difficult situations”.JO Poseidon started at the beginning of March as a continuation of deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (November 2010 - March 2011). Its objectives are the same as these of the RABIT operation: increased level of border surveillance, increased level of border checks and assistance with screening and de-briefing activities. JO Poseidon land brings together border guards from 25 EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries.
