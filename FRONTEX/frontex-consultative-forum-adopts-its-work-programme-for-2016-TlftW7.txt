The Frontex Consultative Forum on Fundamental Rights has set
the priorities for 2016 in its Work Programme, which include the contribution
to development of the Frontex mandate and support of the revision of the
agency’s fundamental rights strategy and action plan.The Frontex Consultative Forum was created in 2012 to assist
the Executive Director and the Management Board in fundamental rights matters
offering strategic advice on how Frontex can improve the respect for
Fundamental Rights in all its activities. The forum brings together 15 members
from relevant EU agencies and international organisations, as well as from
civil society organisations.The CF priorities for 2016 were discussed with Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri and Deputy Chair of the Management Board,
Marko Gasperlin, during the last forum meeting on the beginning of November,
where they were able to present their views on the current needs and how the
Consultative forum could support the agency in 2016.Frontex Executive Director Leggeri also asked the
Consultative Forum for recommendations on how to deal with unaccompanied children
and any relevant advice on the fundamental rights implications of the implementation
of refusals of entry at EU external borders.
The Work Programme was adopted by the Consultative Forum on
16 November and presented to the Frontex Management Board on 26 November.
