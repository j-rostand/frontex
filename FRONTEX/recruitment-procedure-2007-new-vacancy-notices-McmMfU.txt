With the publication of a set of vacancy notices for 10 Contract Agent posts the third round of Frontex recruitment procedure in 2007 has just been launched. In connection with the planned increase of Frontex activities in 2007, there is need for substantial growth of the staff from 70 to 130 – 140 by the end of the year. What do we offer? We offer an interesting career in a multinational environment in the first agency of the European Union established in a new Member State. Our staff is composed of citizens of almost all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries. Being a body of the European Union, we will enable you to gain added value to your national experience by supplementing it with a Community aspect. Besides, the fact that Frontex is still at its initial stage of existence gives us the challenging chance to contribute to the development of this body with new ideas. Frontex applies an equal opportunities policy and accepts applications without distinction on grounds of age, race, political, philosophical or religious conviction, sex or sexual orientation and regardless of disabilities, marital status or family situation.
