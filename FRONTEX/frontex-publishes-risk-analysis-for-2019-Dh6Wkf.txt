In 2018,
the number of detections of illegal border crossings reached its lowest level
in five years, but migratory pressure remained relatively high at the EU’s
external borders, according to the Frontex Risk Analysis for 2019 report that was released today.
The total
figure fell 27% from the previous year to 150 114 and was 92% below the peak of
the migratory in 2015. This was in large part due to the dramatic fall
in the number of migrants on the Central Mediterranean route, where the number
of detections plunged 80% to 23 485.
The Western Mediterranean became the most frequently used
route into Europe. The pressure on Spain has been rising over the last years,
and the number of detections in 2018 reached 57 034, double the number from
2017.  The number of departures from
Morocco increased five-fold. Most of the migrants taking this route last year
came from sub-Saharan countries, but the number of Moroccan nationals also
increased significantly.
The Eastern Mediterranean saw only slightly fewer detections
than the Western Mediterranean route. With 56 561 illegal border crossings, the
pressure was 34% higher than in the preceding year due to the increase in land
crossings from Turkey to Greece.
