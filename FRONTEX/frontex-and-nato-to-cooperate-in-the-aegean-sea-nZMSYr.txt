Frontex and NATO have reached a common understanding on the form
of their cooperation in the Aegean Sea. 
While Frontex will continue to operate in the Aegean in the
framework of operation Poseidon Rapid Intervention, the two organisations will
exchange information in real time. 
Frontex currently deploys 14 vessels and two helicopters in
the Aegean, which support Greek authorities in border surveillance, detection of
migrants and search and rescue operations. In total, Frontex has 739 officers, staff
and crew members on the Greek islands to also support the registration of
migrants.
Since the beginning of 2016, more than 130 000 migrants
arrived on the Greek islands.
