Warsaw, April 29 -  Frontex has today published its Study on the Ethics of Border Security.The Study, commissioned by Frontex and carried out by the Centre for Global Ethics of the University of Birmingham (UK), aims to help the EU border guard community by providing information on 

the ethical standards laid out by EU Border Guard services via an analysis of national Codes of Conduct, 
the ethical standards expected at EU level (as expressed in the relevant EU legislation and policies) in regard to the numerous sensitive tasks carried out by border guards and 
the ethical challenges posed by some of the current and planned technologies employed by border guard services in the EU as part of their daily tasks. 

Together with the recently adopted Frontex Code of Conduct, this study is a vital part of the Frontex Fundamental Rights Strategy, which aims to embed the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms in every aspect of Frontex’s work.  It is also expected that the publication of this study will help in one of Frontex’s core aims of harmonising and raising standards among the EU border guard community.
