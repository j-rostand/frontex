Due to a technical
problem, we must restate the figures for Eastern Mediterranean. Because of
additional incidents reported, the figures for the Central Mediterranean have also
been updated.

These changes also
affected to the total number of detections in May.
In May, the number
of detections of illegal border crossings on Europe’s main migratory routes
rebounded from the previous month’s record lows to
nearly 3 500*. 
The total number of
illegal border crossings for the first five months of 2020 reached 30 800, 9%
below the figure from the same period of last year.
Eastern
Mediterranean
There were some 100**
detections of illegal border crossings on the Eastern Mediterranean route in
May. Because of delayed reporting the figure is likely to rise, but will remain
among the lowest on record.
In the January-May
period, more than 11 500 illegal border crossings were detected on this route,
or 34% fewer than a year ago.

Afghans
remained the top nationality detected on this route so far this
year.
