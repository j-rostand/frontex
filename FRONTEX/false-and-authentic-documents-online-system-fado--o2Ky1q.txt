The use
of false documents has risen significantly in recent years. Just last year,
over 7 000 fraudulent document users were detected at the EU’s external
borders. False documents are a criminal’s favourite tools: they can be used
repeatedly for many illegal activities.



For
years Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, has been at the
frontline of the fight with document and identity fraud. In April, the agency
expanded its presence in this area, becoming responsible for the operation of
the False and Authentic Documents Online system (FADO).Thanks
to FADO, a border guard will need only seconds to verify an ID, driving or
vehicle license. EU Member States and European institutions, along with
airlines, international organisations and many others will be able to benefit
from the system’s database, including information on authentic and false
documents, as well as forgery techniques used by criminals. FADO will be
operated by Frontex’s Centre of Excellence for Combatting Document Fraud (CED).
