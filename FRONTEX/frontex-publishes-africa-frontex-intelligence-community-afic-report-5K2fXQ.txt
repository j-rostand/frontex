The 2015 Africa-Frontex
Intelligence Community (AFIC) Joint Report analyses the irregular migratory
movements affecting AFIC countries and EU Member States, cross-border
criminality and provides an overview of the main regional security threats
affecting the countries in the community.Sub-Saharan Africans are the
single largest group detected for illegal border-crossing on the Central
Mediterranean route towards the EU. The top five nationalities among AFIC
country nationals are Nigerians, Gambians, Senegalese, Malians and Ghanaians.Factors such as a high rate of visa rejections by EU countries for West
Africans, easy access to smuggling networks along the route (Niger, Libya) and
poor return rates for those who are not eligible for international protection
are all contributing to the growing popularity of irregular migratory movements
from West Africa.AFIC was set up in 2010 to provide a framework for regular knowledge and intelligence sharing in the field of border security between Frontex and African countries.Â
