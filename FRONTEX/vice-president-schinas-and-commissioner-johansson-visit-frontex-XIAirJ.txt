Today, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, hosted a visit by EU Commission Vice President for Promoting our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson. Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri briefed Vice President Schinas and Commissioner Johansson about the progress in implementation of the European Border and Coast Guard Regulation which entered into force last December. The guests also paid a visit to the Frontex Situation Centre, European Monitoring Room and Frontex Operational Coordination Centre.“I’m grateful that Vice President Schinas and Commissioner Johansson visit Frontex at such an important moment for us. I am glad that you had an opportunity to meet with the staff of Frontex who are the real force behind the success of this agency and I am very proud to say this,” said Fabrice Leggeri.  “We have already made headway with the creation of the Frontex border corps. We’ve launched the recruitment procedure of the first 700 officers and received an astonishing 7500 applications. This is more than 10 candidates per post. Such interest helped us select high quality officers to this first European uniformed service.”
