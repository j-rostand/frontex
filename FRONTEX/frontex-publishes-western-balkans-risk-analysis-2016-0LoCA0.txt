The numbers of migrants transiting the Balkans who came
outside the region reached unprecedented and extraordinary levels during 2015,
with more than 2 million illegal border crossings reported. This was roughly 30
times more than in 2014 and 19 times higher than the total for the past six
years. The monthly number of detections peaked at 577 000 in October.By far the most influential factors were the introduction of
a facilitated transport corridor across the Western Balkans and a changes of
laws related to border management.
As in previous years, migrants entered the region across its
southern common borders with Greece and Bulgaria, before transiting it
northwards and exiting across the Hungarian-Serbian and the Croatian-Serbian
border.
