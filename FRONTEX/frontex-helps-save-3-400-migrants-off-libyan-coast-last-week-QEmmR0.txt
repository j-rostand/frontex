Vessels and aircraft participating in the Frontex-coordinated
operation Triton helped save nearly 3 400 of the 5 300 migrants rescued last
week off the Libyan coast. Most of the people were rescued in 27 operations
over the weekend (Friday-Sunday), one of the busiest three-day periods since
the operation was launched in November 2014.
The migrants, who came mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa, made
distress calls to the Italian authorities shortly after leaving the Libyan
coast. Most of them travelled in wooden and rubber boats.
“Thousands of migrants have been rescued off the Libyan
coast this weekend and I am proud to say that vessels and aircraft funded by
Frontex helped save more than half of them,” said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri.
 Among the
Frontex-funded vessels taking part in the rescues was Norwegian Siem Pilot, which took aboard 963 people,
including 71 children, rescued from two wooden boats and a rubber dinghy. The Norwegian
vessel transported them to Cagliari, on the island of Sardinia.
“We have never had so many people on board before. We had
many challenges on Saturday as there were so many boats in need at the same
time. We are so happy that we had no casualties,” said Siem Pilot Chief Commander Lise Dunham.
In the first seven months of the year, some 95 000 migrants
were rescued in the Central Mediterranean.
