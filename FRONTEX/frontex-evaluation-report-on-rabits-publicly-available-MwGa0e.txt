The Frontex Evaluation Report on the deployment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABITs) to the Greek-Turkish land border in 2010 is now publically available. Joint Operation RABIT 2010 was the first deployment of its type and its evaluation is a crucial element in maintaining Frontex’s preparedness for rapid response to emergency situations at the EU’s external borders. The scale and speed of the deployment — in terms of both human and technical resources — was unprecedented in the Agency’s history. Experts in such areas as false-document detection, clandestine entry, dog handling, first- and second-line border checks and stolen vehicle detection, as well as specialist interviewers, de-briefers and linguists, were made available and dispatched by 26 Member States and Schengen-Associated Countries (SACs) during the four-month deployment, representing a total of 576 officers working around 19,000 man-days during the four-month operational period.
