In the framework of the ongoing Dialogue on Mediterranean Transit Migration (MTM), in 2006 FRONTEX joined ICMPD and Europol as a partner agency in the implementation of the work of this forum. The MTM Dialogue comprises numerous participating countries from both Arab Partner States (APS) and European Partner States (EPS). The forum last met in Porto 13-14 November 2006 to present the results of the work carried out this year, which included a draft joint assessment by the three agencies, and to launch the follow-up project known as Towards a Comprehensive Response to Mixed Migration Flows. This project will comprise four core areas of work for 2007: interception and apprehension; combating smuggling and trafficking networks; management of detention and reception; return and readmission. Improved Mediterranean cooperation in each of these four areas will be further explored in separate workshops during 2007 with a lead APS and EPS driving the work under the guidance of one of the implementing agencies.

To support the projects, three instruments were developed, being the joint MTM Map on Irregular Mediterranean and African Migration Routes, the draft joint MTM Assessment on Mediterranean and African Migration Flows and the secured-access MTM interactive Map (MTM I-Map) on Irregular Migration Flows and Routes in Africa and the Mediterranean.
