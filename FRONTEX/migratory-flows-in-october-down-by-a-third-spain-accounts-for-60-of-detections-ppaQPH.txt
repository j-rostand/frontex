In the first ten months of 2018, the number of illegal border 
crossings into the EU fell by 31% from a year ago to about 118 900, 
mainly because of lower migratory pressure in the Central Mediterranean.
 Two months before the end of the year, 2018 is on track to see the 
lowest number of illegal border crossings since 2013.In October, 
some 16 000 illegal border crossings were detected on the main 
migratory routes into the EU, close to the figure from the same month of
 last year.
