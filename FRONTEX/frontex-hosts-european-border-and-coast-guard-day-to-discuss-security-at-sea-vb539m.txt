On 24 May, Frontex hosted over 300 European border and coast
guard representatives from more than 30 countries at the annual European Border
and Coast Guard Day. The Agency’s flagship event, renamed to show the fact that
coast guard functions are now covered by Frontex’s expanded mandate, took place
this year in the Polish town of Sopot, the first time in the event’s nine-year
history that it has been organised outside Warsaw.  
“It is in cooperation with the
national coast guards that Frontex forms the European Border and Coast Guard,
and it is in cooperation that we protect the EU’s external borders. The many
different uniforms and national emblems that I see before me testifies to the
fact that we are a truly European body,” said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri. “We can only win the fight against crime and for security
together.”
