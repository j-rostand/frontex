Warsaw, Wednesday October 19 — The 5th EU Anti-Trafficking Day was held in Warsaw on October 18 under the slogan “Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings.” The event organised under the auspices of the Polish Presidency brought together policy-level, law-enforcement and civil society decision makers along with seven Justice and Home Affairs Agencies of the EU to discuss issues affecting the fight against Trafficking in Human Beings (THB). The emphasis of this year’s event was on inter-agency cooperation and practical joint steps to ensure maximum effectiveness in combating this high-priority crime. Under the moderation of EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator Myria Vassiliadou, representatives of the seven Agencies — the European Police College (CEPOL), the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), Eurojust, Europol, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and Frontex — discussed THB-related issues. Later, three workshops dedicated to the three-fold approach of Prevention, Protection and Prosecution, discussed concrete steps towards achieving practical results in the fight against THB. The heads of Agencies present also signed a Joint Statement on the fight against THB.
