Fabrice Leggeri, the Executive
Director of Frontex, visited Dakar this week and met with a range of Senegalese
authorities to discuss issues related to border management and security. He
also opened the Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC) Plenary in Dakar. 
The AFIC, which was established
in 2010, is a knowledge and information exchange network between Frontex and
African countries. It brings together Frontex border security analysts with
those of the partner African authorities. Frontex regularly conducts joint risk
analysis within AFIC focused on the situation at African borders. Senegal was
one of the first network members and remains an active participant. This is a
second AFIC Plenary held in Dakar. The first took place in 2015.
