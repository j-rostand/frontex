Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, is running a workshop at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on traveller risk assessment to better address the threats from cross-border crime and terrorism in air travel.The workshop brings together representatives of border control authorities from Arab countries, EU Member States, EU bodies and the United Nations to discuss and present a range of methods, tools and practices aimed at countering cross-border crime and terrorism when conducting border checks at airports.“It is our shared interest to counter terrorism and ensure the safety of our citizens on the go,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. “We need to continuously improve border security without making life more difficult for legitimate travellers.”The participants will develop a list of guidelines for competent authorities for a more efficient and effective screening of travellers at airports.The workshop is organised by Frontex in cooperation with the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, the General Secretariat of the Arab Interior Ministers Council (AIMC) and the EU-funded CT-MENA project. It is an activity of the EU4BorderSecurity project, run by Frontex and funded by the European Commission’s European Neighbourhood Instrument. The aim of the project is to enhance border security in the Southern Neighbourhood of the European Union by fostering bilateral and regional cooperation while facilitating bona fide travel.
