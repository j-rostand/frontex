Nearly 27 500 migrants reached the Italian shores in
October, the highest monthly number ever recorded in the Central Mediterranean
and more than twice as many as in the previous month.A key reason for the unprecedented number was improved weather
that followed relatively poor weather conditions in September. Encouraged by
this, people smugglers crammed even more migrants onto unseaworthy boats before
the winter weather sets in, leading to a very high number of deaths.There were 127 bodies recovered in the Central Mediterranean
region in October and likely many more drowned.“I visited Italy recently and we are working closely with
the Italian authorities to increase Frontex’s support in the hotspots for
registration, nationality screening and efficient return of migrants who do not
have a right to remain in the EU,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri. “Frontex is also working with EUNAVFOR MED operation SOPHIA to train
the Libyan coast guard and help build border control capacity of the national
authorities in Libya.”Nigerians and Eritreans accounted for the largest number of
the rescued migrants last month.So far this year, nearly 159 500 migrants arrived in Italy,
13% more than a year ago.EASTERN MEDITERRANEANMeanwhile, the number of migrants arriving on the Greek
islands in the Eastern Aegean continued to amount to just a fraction of the
figures from a year ago. Some 3 100 people were detected in October, in line
with the previous month. This brought the figure for the first 10 months of
this year to 170 000, although most of the arrivals took place between January
and March.The three main nationalities on this route in October were
Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans. WESTERN BALKANSA similar drop was visible in the Western Balkans, where the
number of detections of illegal border-crossings in October stood at 1 700,
less than 1% of the figure from the same month a year ago. Nationals from
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq continued to account for a large majority of the
migrants on this route. Note:
The data presented in
this statement refer to the number of detections of illegal border-crossing at
the external borders of the European Union. The same person may attempt to
cross the border illegally several times in different locations at the external
border.
