More than 370 people were rescued off the Libyan coast this
week after their vessels were detected on satellite images taken as part of
Frontex’s Eurosur Fusion Services. The operation was made possible by the
cooperation between experts at Frontex and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), Italian authorities and EUNAVFORMED.On Tuesday, 6 October, Frontex Situation Centre in
cooperation with EMSA spotted several
small boats on a satellite scan of an area close to the Libyan coast, where
migrant boats in distress are often detected. The information was passed on to
the Italian authorities, which informed the EUNAVFORMED flagship Cavour present
in the area.As a result, more than 370 migrants aboard three rubber boats were
rescued and brought to the Italian shores. The people included nine children and four pregnant women.Eurosur is an information exchange framework designed to
improve the management of Europe’s external borders.The Eurosur services already include automated large vessel
tracking and detection capabilities, software functionalities allowing complex
calculations for predicting positions and detecting suspicious activities of
vessels, as well as precise weather and oceanographic forecasts. Fusion
Services use optical and radar satellite technology to help locate vessels at
sea. Recent upgrades of their technical capabilities make it possible to spot
smaller vessels.
Last month, the Greek Coast Guard seized some 5 000 guns and
boxes with ammunition aboard a Libya-bound cargo ship that had been monitored
by Frontex as part of the Eurosur Fusion Services.
