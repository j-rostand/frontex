Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, in
partnership with the Hellenic Coast Guard, has launched a one-month trial of an
aerostat and other equipment for border surveillance on the Greek island of
Samos.
The aerostat pilot project aims to assess the capacity and cost efficiency of aerostat performing sea
surveillance in an operational environment. The aerostat will be flown
at various altitudes to test its use for effective surveillance to detect
unauthorised border crossings, support sea rescue operations and combat
cross-border crime.
One of the core tasks of Frontex is to identify various
technologies that can be used for border control. The agency has tested a
variety of technologies, including biometrics, automated border crossing gates
now commonly used at international airports and Remotely Piloted Aircraft
Systems.Â
