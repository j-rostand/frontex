Every year millions of people fall into the hands of traffickers. 
Trafficking in human beings is one of the most profitable forms of 
organised crime, generating billions of Euros for criminal networks.Often
 a border guard is the first â€“ and sometimes only - law enforcement 
officer that a victim of human trafficking may ever come in contact 
with. This is why Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, 
trains border guards across Europe on how to detect potential victims of
 trafficking and refer them to national authorities. The agency also 
organises operations targeting this crime.
