Interoperability, flexibility, security, reliability and end-user friendliness were main features pointed-out by participants of SeBoCom Workshop held last week in Ispra (Italy). 
 
Frontex together with Joint Research Centre of the European Commission organised a workshop aiming at setting the ground for a new project in the area of secure and interoperable communications for border security agencies. End users and representatives of private sector were brought together to share different views and experiences. 
 
End-users have had opportunity to present their real-life experiences in joint operations and describe precise needs they have for a reliable communication system. They could also make themselves acquainted with the state of the art technology in the area of secure communications presented by industries.
