Italian authorities rescued 2
400 migrants who left Libya on wooden fishing boats and rubber dinghies ahead
of the Easter holiday last week, including 318 migrants rescued by Icelandic Coast
Guard vessel Týr taking part in the
Frontex-coordinated Joint Operation Triton.The migrants took advantage of a brief window
of favourable weather starting at the beginning of April to venture out in
hopes of reaching the Italian coast.“Once again a vessel participating in the
Frontex-coordinated Triton operation took part in the rescue of migrants and
did so close to the Libyan coast. We will continue to do our part to save lives
in the Mediterranean,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.Most of the migrants - mainly
from the Sub-Saharan region of Africa but also Syrians and Palestinians - were
intercepted in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations some 30-40 NM off the Libyan
coast.  The migrants called for help
using satellite phones. Several merchant vessels also took part in the rescue
operations. The Italian Coast Guard
transferred the migrants it rescued, including children and pregnant women, to
the island of Lampedusa and the Sicilian ports of Augusta and Porto Empedocle.
The migrants rescued by Týr disembarked
in Pozzallo, Sicily.Excluding last week’s
incidents, more than 24 400 irregular migrants were rescued on the Central Mediterranean
 route since the launch of Joint Operation
Triton in November 2014, including nearly 7 860 with the participation of
assets co-financed by Frontex.
