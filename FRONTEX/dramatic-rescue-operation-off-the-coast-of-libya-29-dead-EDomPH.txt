On Monday night a rubber boat with 106 sub-Saharan migrants
was rescued by the Italian Coast Guard, which conducted a dramatic search and
rescue operation 120 NM from Lampedusa. 29 people, including three minors, died
of hypothermia. On Sunday, February 8th at 13:00, the Maritime
Search and Rescue Authority in Rome received a distress call from migrants on
board of a rubber boat 120 NM from Lampedusa (40 NM from Tripoli). The Italian
authorities immediately dispatched four patrol boats - two of which were co-financed
by Frontex – to rescue the migrants in distress. It also redirected a merchant
vessel Bourbon Argos to the position. The extremely difficult weather conditions – rain, hail and Force
8 Sea (Beaufort scale), with the wind exceeding 120 km/h, made the operation very
difficult. The Coast Guard boats finally entered the port of Lampedusa with
migrants on board on Monday night around 20:00. One of the vessels suffered engine
breakdown due to the severe weather. “Another terrible
tragedy occurred in the Mediterranean. The fact that people smugglers put so
many migrants on a small rubber boat in such appalling weather conditions only
demonstrates their increasing ruthlessness and willingness to put profit over
human lives,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.  “I would like to praise the courage and determination of the
Italian Coast Guard officers who risked their lives to conduct such a complex
and risky operation,” he added.
Since the launch of Triton, on November 1st 2014, 19,000
people have been rescued, including 6,000 who were saved using vessels and
other equipment financed by Frontex.
