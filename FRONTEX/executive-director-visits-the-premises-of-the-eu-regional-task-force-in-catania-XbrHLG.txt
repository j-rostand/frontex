On 26 June, Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri, together with Giovanni Pinto, Director for
Immigration and Border Police and the Deputy Director of Europol, Wil van
Gemert, visited the premises offered by the Italian authorities to host the EU
Regional Task Force in Catania, Sicily.During the visit,
Fabrice Leggeri signed an exchange of letters with Italian Ministry of Interior
and the Municipality of Catania related to the use of the building.The new premises have
been set up as part of the hot spot approach recommended by the European
Commission’s Agenda on Migration. In the past weeks inter- agency talks
have taken place between Frontex, Europol, EASO and Eurojust with a view to
creating an EU Regional Task Force to coordinate and render more efficient the
work of the EU agencies involved in the field. ‘The aim of
the Task Force is to bring EU Agencies jointly closer to the areas most
affected by disproportionate migratory flows - said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri. ‘Frontex will remain in Italy for as long as our assistance is
required’ – he added.  The Task Force will also provide logistical and operational
support both to the experts and technical equipment deployed in the framework
of Frontex coordinated joint operation Triton and Europol - led Joint
Operational Team MARE.
The Frontex component of the Task Force will initially be
composed of four operational officers who will work closely with Italian
liaison officers from national bodies responsible for operational coordination,
intelligence-gathering and the fight against people smuggling and human
trafficking networks.
