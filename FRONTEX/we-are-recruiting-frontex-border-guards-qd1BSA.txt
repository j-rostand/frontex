Today, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency,
is launching the recruitment campaign for Europe’s first uniformed service –
the European Border and Coast Guard
standing corps.
The corps is a unique service that will carry out border
control and migration management tasks to assist EU member states. These will
include identity and document checks, border surveillance and return of people
who are illegally staying in the European Union.
“Today is a special
day for Frontex, one that will lead to a true transformation of our agency. For
the first time Frontex will have its owned uniformed service, working under the
banner of the European Union,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
“We will be able to
assist EU member states with challenges at their borders in a variety of ways with
our own officers and equipment,” he added.
The European Border and Coast Guard standing corps will consist
of Frontex border guards and national officers from EU member states and
Schengen-associated countries.
Today Frontex is starting the first recruitment campaign for
more than 700 Frontex border guards. Candidates will have until 16 December to
apply.
