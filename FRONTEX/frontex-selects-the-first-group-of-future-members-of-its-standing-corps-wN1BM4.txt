Frontex, the European
Border and Coast Guard Agency, has extended job offers to candidates to become
the first members of the European Border and Coast Guard standing corps, the European
Union’s first uniformed law enforcement service.
Despite the numerous challenges related to the COVID-19
pandemic, Frontex has continued the recruitment process for the standing corps,
which is expected to be ready to be deployed at the beginning of next year. 
“The pandemic has
shown that now, more than ever, Europe needs the European Border and Coast
Guard standing corps that will be able to act immediately and support national
border guards at our external borders,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri.
The first batch of more than 280 selected candidates received job offers this week. They will begin their online training in mid-June and will
take part in a physical training programme later this year. It will ensure that
the officers have the necessary skills to work together in any particular
operational area, fully complying with the applicable EU law and ethical
standards.
The standing corps will be composed of Frontex and EU Member
States’ officers, who will at any time be able to support the Member States
facing challenges at their external borders.
The Agency received 7 500 applications from candidates
interested in becoming Frontex border guards. It is continuing the selection
procedure for other candidates who may also be offered a position in the
standing corps later this year after completing all the stages of the
recruitment process, which includes an interview, English exam and physical
aptitude test. Those who will be selected will also undergo a six-month training
programme before participating in operational activities.
