On 12 June, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, opened a Risk Analysis Cell in Dakar in cooperation with Senegalese
authorities within the framework of the Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community
(AFIC). 
Taking part in the opening in Senegal were representatives
of Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, as well as
other international partners. 
The role of the cells, which are run by local analysts
trained by Frontex, is to collect and analyse strategic data on cross-border
crime in various African countries and support relevant authorities involved in
border management.
This includes information on illegal border crossings,
document fraud, trafficking in human beings and other types of cross-border
crime. It is shared with authorities at national and regional level to produce
analysis and policy recommendations, as well as with Frontex. The project is
financed by the European Commission (DG DEVCO).
