More than 500 stolen cars and more than a tonne of drugs were stopped at
 the border crossings at Europeâ€™s land borders over less than two weeks 
as part of an operation led by Frontex, the European Border and Coast 
Guard Agency. Thanks to the cooperation with Bulgarian customs, 700 kg of
heroin was seized at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey, a record amount of
drugs seized in that area.
