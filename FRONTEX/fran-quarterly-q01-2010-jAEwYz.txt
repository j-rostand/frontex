The Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN) report covering the first three months of 2010 showed a significant drop in all indicators of irregular migration at the external borders of the EU.
These lows continue a general decreasing trend already noticeable in 2009 and are attributed to reduced employment opportunities for irregular immigrants in the EU, combined with stricter migration and asylum policies in Member States and more effective co-operation with key countries of origin.
