This week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, hosted the 24th International Border Police Conference (IBPC), a bi-annual event that brought together law enforcement executives from nearly 100 countries on five continents, as well as representatives of international organisations, EU institutions and agencies.In total, more than 300 participants took part in the conference, which focused on cross-border security through preparedness, prevention and response to global challenges such as terrorism, people smuggling, and document and identity fraud. “The International Border Police Conference is a unique opportunity to bring together the leaders of the global border and coast guard community. We all have one common goal – to ensure that borders easily connect people and businesses, while preventing cross-border crime,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
