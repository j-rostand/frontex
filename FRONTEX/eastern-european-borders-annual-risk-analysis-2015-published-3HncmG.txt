In 2014, only 0.5% of all illegal border-crossings
reported by EU Member States at the external borders took place at the 6
000-kilometre-long eastern borders of the EU, totalling 1 275.Meanwhile, the economic downturn in Russia led to a
decline in regular traffic flows at EU Member States’ borders with the country,
with the weakening rouble reducing the number of Russian travellers and
shoppers crossing the EU borders. This trend was the most pronounced near the
end of last year.In contrast to the EU’s borders with the Russian
Federation, the number of travellers at the border with Ukraine has been
growing despite the conflict in the eastern part of the country and the
deteriorating economic situation in the region. The number of people who were refused
entry reported by EU Member States at the eastern borders fell to almost 36 700
down from over 50 000 in 2013, although these still accounted for a third of
all refusals at EU borders.The falling value of the rouble and the Ukrainian hryvnia, which increased the price
differences between the EU and its eastern neighbours, encouraged
the smuggling of goods across EU’s eastern borders. The smuggling, particularly
of cigarettes, occurred pri­marily through official border-crossing points
(BCPs), although some took place at green borders (be­tween BCPs). The methods
used to bring goods across the border varied from the so-called ant smuggling
through BCPs to the use of rafts on rivers to smuggle large amounts of
cigarettes across the common borders. Even though 2014 was marked by fewer
incidents, they involved larger amounts of smuggled il­licit cigarettes.The situation in Ukraine, the consequences of the
economic crisis in Russia and its migration policy remain the most important
uncertainties affecting the outlook for the region. So far the impact of the
Ukrainian crisis on border security has remained limited, but it still is by
far the most important source of current and future population movements in the
region, considering that the number of internally displaced person in the
country surpassed one million.
