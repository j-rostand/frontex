Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri and Executive Director of eu-LISA Krum Garkov signed a
bilateral Annual Cooperation Plan for 2015 at eu-LISA’s
headquarters in Tallinn on 17 March. The agreement covers cooperation
areas related to the Smart Borders pilot led by eu-LISA in 2015,
joint coordination of expert working groups in the field of border
control, training and IT security. In addition, the two directors
also discussed monitoring and use of new technologies and research. 
“The meeting took place at a
particularly important time for the two agencies. Major political and
security issues are high on the European agenda and operational
agencies, such as Frontex and eu-LISA, are facing demanding
expectations from the national authorities of the Member States and
EU citizens alike. Responding to these expectations is a matter of
priority and both Agencies are making significant efforts to
facilitate the implementation of all the relevant measures,” said
Krum Garkov.Fabrice Leggeri added: “Supporting EU
policy makers in the development of new projects is also one of
Frontex missions. I am glad to join efforts with eu-LISA to optimise
our services delivered to the Commission, the border guard community
and to the European citizens.”​
The two agencies signed a Working
Arrangement on 31 January 2014. According to the document, eu-LISA
and Frontex exchange expertise and best practices primarily in the
areas of ICT-related projects and services, research and development
activities, training and programming.
