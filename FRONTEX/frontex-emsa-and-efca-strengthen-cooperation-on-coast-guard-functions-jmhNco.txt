The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), the European 
Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency 
(EMSA) took a significant step in structuring their cooperation on coast
 guard functions by signing a Tripartite Working Arrangement as foreseen
 by the amended founding regulations of the three Agencies of October 
last year.
