Last week, EU member states’ liaison officers posted in African countries met for two days in Las Palmas, Spain, to discuss the main findings of the AFIC 2016 Joint Report. They exchanged information on border security and cross-border crime, including people smuggling and trafficking activities linking Africa with the EU.The Africa-Frontex Intelligence Community (AFIC) was set up in 2010 to provide a platform for exchange of knowledge and intelligence in the field of border security between Frontex and African countries.“AFIC is a unique possibility for EU member states to share information and intelligence on smuggling networks operating in Africa,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.During last week’s meeting, discussions ranged from a variety of border security concerns affecting the region including organised crime groups responsible for majority of migrant smuggling between Africa and Europe, to more specific issues, such as visa fraud.Participants included 32 liaison officers posted in African countries, as well as representatives of the European Commission and experts from Europol, Spanish Guardia Civil, National Police and Frontex.The participants also observed integrated border management in practice during their visit to the Regional Coordination Centre which coordinates all activities related to the management of migratory flows towards Canary Island.Frontex shared information on the current situation, along with analysis of likely future scenario. The participants also discussed future activities to take place within the scope of the work of AFIC promoted by Frontex.The report discussed during the meeting is expected to be published in January 2017.
