Starting today, Frontex, the European Border and
Coast Guard Agency, will be able to deploy as many as 1 500 border guards at
short notice to assist member states in emergency situations at their EUâ€™s
external borders. The creation of the rapid reaction pool is a significant
milestone in the development of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency,
which was launched in October.
