In the first quarter of 2016, the number of
illegal border-crossings by migrants travelling from Turkey, Greece and
Bulgaria dropped 84% from the previous three months to 215 000.  The fall became more pronounced in February
and March, when coordinated restriction measures were introduced at regional
level and, ultimately, the transit corridor was closed. After the closure in
March, the number of detections dropped to the level close to that of the same
month in 2015 and helped reduce the number of people arriving on the Greek
islands from Turkey.This number was cut even further after the
EU-Turkey statement that came into effect on March 20.Fewer than 2 500 of the illegal border
crossings were associated with regional migrants in the first quarter.
The number of people smugglers detected on
the Western Balkan route fell for the second consecutive quarter to 261, its lowest
since the third quarter of 2014. However, the decision to close the organised
transit corridor is likely to increase migrants’ demand for people smuggling
services.
