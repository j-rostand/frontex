Today at approximately  5 am the Icelandic vessel ICGV Týr deployed by Frontex within the framework of joint operation Triton received a request from the Italian Coast Guard to assist some 450 migrants aboard a freighter, which was proceeding towards the Italian coast on autopilot after having been abandoned by the crew.  Among those in need of assistance are women (some pregnant) and about 60 children. The interception of the vessel by the Icelandic OPV took place 44 nautical miles south of Italy.A rescue operation was initially impossible due to the very bad weather conditions and the fact that the freighter was proceeding at full speed. It was not until some hours later, when the vessel carrying the migrants ran out of fuel, that five Icelandic officers were able to get on board on the vessel, attach a tow rope and bring the ship under control.  They are currently towing the vessel towards Corigliano Calabro in Italy. The migrants aboard were visibly distressed but overall in good medical condition – they have been provided with food, water and basic medical assistance. Bad weather conditions make it impossible to board any migrants on the Icelandic vessel for the moment.  However, the Italian Coast Guard have since landed by helicopter 6 officers, who are currently manning the vessel being towed. For more information please contact the Italian Coast Guard:guardiacostiera@guardiacostiera.it
