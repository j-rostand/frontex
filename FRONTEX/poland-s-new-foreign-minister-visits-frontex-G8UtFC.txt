Poland’s newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs Witold
Waszczykowski met with Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri today to
discuss the agency’s various activities at the European Union’s external
borders and the development of Frontex’s role in the future.“We were honoured to host Minister Waszczykowski at our
Warsaw headquarters less than a day after he was sworn in as the new foreign
minister. The fact that this was one of the minister’s first visits after taking
office is a very encouraging sign and shows Poland’s interest in supporting
Frontex,” Fabrice Leggeri said.The Frontex Executive Director told Minister Waszczykowski
about the situation at the EU’s external borders, the migratory pressure faced
by many Member States and how Frontex is helping them to deal with the unprecedented
situation. Among other topics discussed were the creation of Hotspots in Greece
and Italy to help handle the registration of migrants and Frontex’s role in
coordinating the returns of migrants not entitled to international protection.
Minister Waszczykowski and Executive Director Leggeri also
discussed the future of the agency, including the expansion of its current mandate.
