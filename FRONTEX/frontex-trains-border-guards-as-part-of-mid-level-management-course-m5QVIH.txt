Today Frontex launched the Mid-level Management Course (MLC) for
border guards at the Croatian Police Academy in Zagreb. Participants include 17 officers
with mid-level managerial experience coming from 13 EU Member
States.
The aim of the training is to improve participants’ leadership
skills, provide them with practical knowledge of fundamental rights in
operational activities, as well as to expand their knowledge of border
management in the European context. It will also allow for sharing of expertise
between the participants.
The training, divided into four modules, will take place in 5
European countries, namely Italy, Germany, Portugal, Romania and Spain over
the course of six months. 
Last
year, 15 participants from EU Member States and
Iceland successfully completed the course. The training was developed in line
with the Sectoral Qualification Framework (SQF) and Bologna and Copenhagen
principles.
In order to harmonise border guard education, Frontex develops
common training standards for border authorities of EU Member States and
Schengen Associated Countries. This allows for the development of 
equally high border control standards across EU’s external borders.
