On 8 July 2015, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri welcomed the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders in the
headquarters of the Agency in Warsaw.
During the meeting, the two discussed the current
migratory pressure at the external borders of the European Union.

“The situation in Central Mediterranean, in Greece and in
Hungary is particularly concerning,” said Fabrice Leggeri.  

“In line with the ‘hot spot’ approach - part of the
Agenda for Migration which was recently tabled by the European Commission,
Frontex has recently opened the European Regional Task Force in Italy where,
together with other EU agencies, we are assisting the Italian authorities in
managing the migratory flows,” he added.


Since the beginning of the year, over 67 000
migrants have arrived in the area covered by Operation Triton, most of them
originating from Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia and a variety of Sub-Saharan and
West African countries. 

This year, Greece has registered a significant increase
in the number of irregular migrants when compared to the same period in 2014.
More than 79 000 migrants arrived mainly on the Greek islands since the
beginning of the year until June 2015. The majority of them are Syrian refugees
followed by Afghan and Pakistani nationals. 

“We have significantly strengthened Operation Triton in
Italy and we are now looking into reinforcing our operational presence in
Greece, where the situation remains difficult,” added Leggeri. 
Hungary is also experiencing an unprecedented increase of
migratory flows at its border with Serbia with a total of 67 000 migrants
intercepted – most of them initially entered the EU in Greece or Bulgaria. 

The Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders
added that the Netherlands will remain a committed contributor to its important
work for Europe.
