On 7-8 May, Frontex is co-hosting a conference with the International 
Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to discuss border 
management cooperation in the Mediterranean region, acknowledging that 
closer cooperation on international migration is needed amid heightened 
security concerns. The event, held under the auspices of the Bulgarian 
Presidency of the Council of the EU, brings together representatives 
from the EU Member States and countries from the EU’s southern 
neighbourhood.“Mobility and migration represent an opportunity for societies, economies and individuals to grow and develop,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
 “However, not all the consequences of this increased movement are so 
positive, with poverty, war, climate change, and organised crime driving
 increasing numbers of travellers and goods across the globe.”
