European agencies have been set up in successive waves since the mid 1970s and today form an important part of the EUâ€™s institutional landscape. Responding to needs identified by the EU and its Member States, they perform a variety of legal, technical and scientific tasks across a broad range of policy areas.
Each agency is unique and fulfils an individual function. Together they provide information and advice, prepare and take decisions, oversee operations and support policymaking. While some develop know-how and expertise, others integrate different interest groups and facilitate dialogue at European and international level.
Today the agencies represent a significant presence across the Member States, their location helping to bring the EU closer to its citizens.
Entrusting the agencies with specific tasks has become an established part of the way in which the EU now conducts its business.
At the upcoming exhibition at the European Parliament, the agencies will present in four thematic clusters how they work together on a broad range of policy issues.
