Frontex began testing a new accelerated process of identifying and registering migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos today as part of its efforts
to assist Greece in handling the thousands of people arriving at its shores each
day.The entire process takes place at a mobile office, set up as
part of the implementation of the “hotspot” approach. Inside, a team composed
of two Frontex guest officers works together with Greek authorities to register
migrants and provide them with information on international protection.More than 35 people, including several Syrian families, have
already passed through the new facilities established by Frontex in Moria,
where they were registered and had their fingerprints scanned electronically
with a Eurodac device. At the end of the process, a European Asylum Support
Office (EASO) official explained the possibility of requesting international protection and
the relocation mechanism.“The entire process takes place under one roof, which will
speed up registration considerably. Registration opens the door to asylum
procedures for people in need of international protection,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.The newly launched pilot project will be tested over the
next month to establish standard registration packages for additional
registration centres in cooperation with EU agencies eu-LISA and EASO. Ultimately
each will have four Frontex registration teams working continuously in shifts,
24 hours a day.
Nearly half a million migrants have arrived in Greece so far
this year, with more than half coming to Lesbos.
