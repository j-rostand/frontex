More than 5 500 migrants have
been rescued near the Libyan coast since Thursday, 30 April. Some 1 200 lives
were saved with the direct participation of vessels and aircraft taking part in
the Frontex-coordinated Triton operation, including newly deployed assets from
EU Member States.“I am proud to say that all of the
vessels participating in Triton took an active part in the rescue operations
over the last several days, helping to save thousands of lives. These already
included assets contributed by Member States following last month’s
extraordinary European Council meeting,” said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri.“We are integrating the new
vessels into our operation and are working out details with the Member States
who pledged more assets for Triton. We will see new vessels joining Triton in
the coming weeks,” Leggeri added.Following the rescue operations
that involved more than 30 migrant boats, 2 500 migrants were brought to Italy
and 3 000 additional migrants were on their way there. Unfortunately, rescuers
also recovered bodies of ten dead migrants. Assisting in the rescue
operations over the weekend were 12 vessels and three aircraft taking part in
the Triton operation. Excluding the most recent
incidents, 24,000 migrant lives have been saved in the Mediterranean since the
start of the year, with about a third rescued with the help of Frontex-funded
vessels.
