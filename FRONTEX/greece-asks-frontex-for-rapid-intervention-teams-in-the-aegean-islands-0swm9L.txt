Greece asked Frontex yesterday to launch a Rapid Border
Intervention Teams (RABIT) mechanism on the Greek islands in the Aegean, where
it continues to face massive migratory pressure. Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri has five working days to evaluate the situation and decide
whether to activate the RABIT mechanism. The RABIT mechanism provides rapid operational assistance to
a requesting member state facing urgent and exceptional migratory pressure at its
external borders.  If Frontex accepts Greece’s request for a RABIT mechanism, the
agency would ask EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries for border
guards and equipment for the operation. Under the RABIT Regulation, Member
States would be mandated to contribute these, unless they themselves face an
exceptional situation substantially affecting the discharge of national tasks.All border guards deployed by Frontex in a RABIT operation
work under the command of the national authorities of the requesting member
state.Frontex is already assisting the Greek authorities in the
Aegean islands where in the framework of operation Poseidon Sea the agency deploys
16 vessels and two helicopters, along with 195 officers who help register
migrants and collect intelligence about people smuggling networks. Just in the
hotspot on Lesbos, Frontex currently deploys 83 officers.Yesterday, Frontex also agreed with Greece to expand its
activities to the country’s border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, where the agency will assist Greece with registration of migrants. The
deployment of additional officers will begin next week.
In October, Frontex called on member states to provide 775
border guards for its activities, with 600 to be deployed in Greece. Member states
have so far offered 447 officers.
