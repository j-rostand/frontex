Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri has requested Greek authorities to provide the agency with a progress report and information about the incident, which resulted in the death of a 17-year-old migrant near the Greek island of Symi on Saturday.On early Saturday afternoon, a Latvian patrol vessel deployed in
operation Poseidon Sea detected a yacht with more than 90 migrants aboard in
Symi Island’s Marathounta Bay.None of the officers from the Latvian vessel involved in the
incident used any weapons.“Even though it is absolutely clear that the Latvian
officers deployed by Frontex did not fire any shots, it is still a very concerning
situation,” Leggeri said.“I have tasked the Frontex liaison officer in Piraeus
to be in close contact with the Greek authorities to collect any additional information
needed to shed light on what exactly happened. I understand the Greek
authorities have launched their own criminal investigation,” he added.Frontex will use this information for internal assessment on
possible consequences for Frontex-coordinated operations.
The Greek police arrested two suspected smugglers who were
on the yacht.
