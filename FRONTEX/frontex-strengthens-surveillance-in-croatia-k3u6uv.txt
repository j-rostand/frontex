Last week, a Frontex surveillance airplane started monitoring the EU’s 
external borders in the Western Balkans area as part of Frontex 
Multipurpose Aerial Surveillance (MAS). This is a swift and tailored 
response to the request made by Croatian authorities to monitor the 
migration flows and help Croatia, as well as the neighbouring Western 
Balkan countries, address the challenges on the ground.MAS uses surveillance planes that stream video and other data directly 
to the Frontex Situation Centre (FSC) at the agency’s headquarters in 
Warsaw where a team of experts analyses the data to provide quick 
feedback to relevant national authorities. It is an example of a new 
service that Frontex can offer with its autonomous technical equipment. 
Experts from Croatian authorities are present on board of the airplane, 
ensuring compliance with national procedures.
