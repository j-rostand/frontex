Frontex is deeply engaged in assisting Greece to handle the
unprecedented numbers of migrants who had been arriving on its Aegean islands
in recent months. Currently, Frontex deploys 477 officers throughout Greece,
including 172 crew members of vessels helping to patrol Greek waters. This
compares to 220 officers deployed by Frontex in October.
On the islands most affected by the inflow of migrants,
Frontex has 264 officers assisting in the registration of new arrivals, as well
as border surveillance officers, and debriefing and document experts.
To increase the number of officers assisting Greece, in
October Frontex called on EU Member States to provide 775 border guards for its
activities, with 600 to be deployed in Greece. Member States have so far
offered 447 officers. 
“Frontex
is grateful for the contributions, but more efforts are still needed,” said
Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.
In all of 2015, Frontex launched six calls for border guard
officers and technical equipment to be deployed in Frontex operations.
Greece had also asked the agency to pay the daily
subsistence allowances of 1,535 Greek police officers, which Frontex cannot
provide within the framework of its current mandate.
Frontex will also expand its activities to Greece’s border
with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the agency will assist
with registration of migrants. The deployment of additional officers will begin
next week.
In
the margins of today’s JHA Council, Greek Minister Yannis Mouzalas underlined
that Greece appreciates the agency's assistance and welcomes additional
support. Frontex Executive Director confirmed that the agency has been upscaling
its activities in Greece in the last months and stressed that it will further
support the country with the border guards deployed by EU Member States.
