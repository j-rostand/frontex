The OSCE Secretariat and Frontex, the European Border and
Coast Guard Agency, agreed to strengthen their co-operation in combating
cross-border crime, trafficking in human beings and addressing migratory
challenges in a Working Arrangement document last week.



The document, signed by OSCE Secretary General
Thomas Greminger and Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri, covers
different areas of mutual interest, including promoting and enhancing good
practices in border management, ensuring fundamental rights protection of
people at the borders, and continuing to develop capacities to address emerging
forms of cross-border crime.
