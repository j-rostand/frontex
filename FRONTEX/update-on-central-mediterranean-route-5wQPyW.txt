General characteristicsThis
route refers to irregular migration coming from Northern Africa towards Italy
and Malta across the Mediterranean Sea. Here, Libya often acts as nexus point
where migrants from the Horn of Africa and Western African routes meet before
embarking on their journey towards the EU. Until 2011, with its relatively
prosperous economy, Libya offered good job opportunities for migrant workers
from other African countries who either used it as a destination country or as
a transit country where they could earn some money to pay smugglers for the
last leg of their journey.
The migrants arriving in Italy and
Malta mostly use wooden fishing boats which are often overcrowded
and thus prone to sinking or capsizing in high-sea conditions and are often ill-equipped
with poor engines and navigation systems; two factors contributing to the risk to
life. As a result of these practices, tens
of thousands of people become the subject of search-and-rescue (SAR) in the
Mediterranean every year. Frontex operations took part in almost 900 SAR cases
off Europe’s southern borders between 2011 and 2013, affecting almost 50,000
people in distress.
While
most migrants using this route depart from Libya and land on Lampedusa or
Sicily, others also arrive on the southern Italian coast, around Calabria and
Puglia. These migrants arrive on boats from the Turkish coast, Greece or Egypt.
The smugglers are of many different nationalities and use different types of
boat, but the smugglers using fishing boats are most commonly Egyptian
nationals.
Migratory trendsFor years, this route has been an important entry point to the EU for irregular
migrants and in 2008 nearly 40 000 migrants were detected, mostly near
Lampedusa and Malta. Most migrants were nationals of Tunisia, Nigeria, Somalia
and Eritrea. This traffic stopped almost completely however after the Italian government
signed a bilateral agreement with Libya in 2009. 
Civil
unrest erupting in Tunisia and Libya in 2011 saw a massive spike in the number
of migrants using this route (nearly 60 000 arrivals for the year). Between
January and March only, some 20 000 Tunisians, mostly economic migrants heading
mainly to France in search of job opportunities, arrived on the small Italian
island of Lampedusa. These numbers were later reduced by 75% in the second
quarter of the year as a result of an accelerated repatriation agreement
between Italy and Tunisia. Between March and August 2011 however, exceptionally
high numbers of sub-Saharan Africans departing from Libya arrived on Lampedusa
and to a lesser degree on Sicily and Malta, many of whom were forcibly expelled
by the Gaddafi regime and most of whom applied for asylum in Italy.
With
the end of the Gaddafi regime in August 2011, the migratory pressure dropped
off greatly and detections on this route in 2012 stood at approximately 10 000.

Between
January and September 2013, more than 31 000 migrants had arrived in the EU
using this route, mainly via Sicily and Lampedusa, but also, to a lesser
extent, on the Coasts of Calabria, Puglia and Malta, which is also under
increasing migratory pressure. The main nationalities include Eritreans,
Somalis and other sub-Saharan Africans, as well as Syrian nationals. It is
noteworthy that the migratory pressure over the summer months of 2013 was comparable
to the same period in 2011.
