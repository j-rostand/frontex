operation off the Greek island of Farmakonisi over the weekend. In total, 99 people
were saved after their wooden boat capsized in high winds. Greek forces also
recovered 34 bodies, including 15 children. The search and rescue operation is
still ongoing.The Latvian helicopter and a Latvian patrol boat, which are
both taking part in the Frontex-coordinated Operation Poseidon, also took part
in a search for four boys between the ages of 8 and 13, north of Samos Island
on Saturday. The four were reported missing after a small yacht carrying 29
migrants capsized. The search operation led by Greek authorities continues. Also over the weekend, Norwegian rescue boat Pater Henry von
Koss rescued 32 Syrians including eight children, near Lesbos Island. The
people, many without life jackets, were in the water and their small boat was
nowhere to be found. Search operations are ongoing for one male passenger
reported missing by his brother.

Frontex took part in some 50 search and rescue operations near the Greek
islands in the Aegean.
