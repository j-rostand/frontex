On 17-18 June 2015 Frontex will hold the Global Conference
on the Future of Border Checks 2015 in Warsaw, Poland. The conference can be
followed online. The conference provides a platform to discuss the practical
steps needed to develop and implement a risk-based approach to border checks,
while enabling better resource allocation and increased cost-effectiveness. The
programme focuses on
highlighting operational challenges and solutions, with an emphasis on the
technologies and services that could change the current border checks paradigm
and their potential impact on day-to-day operations at the border. The conference will also examin cutting-edge research
developments in the area of personal identification, which in the future could
be used to advance technological innovations in the border control domain.
The audience consists of national authorities from the EU
Member States and other countries, EU policy-makers, international
organisations, airport authorities, carriers, as well as industry representatives
and researchers involved in developing innovative border checks solutions.
