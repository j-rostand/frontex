Today Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, commemorates the World Refugee Day with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Data from the annual Global Trends report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that the number of people fleeing war, persecution and conflict exceeded 70 million in 2018, from which nearly 26 million were refugees. Some of them come to Europe via its land, sea and air borders, often risking their lives and falling victim to trafficking in human beings or people smuggling. Officers deployed by the Frontex at EU’s external borders contribute to identifying and referring persons in need of protection to the authorities, rescuing lives at sea and responding to the needs of vulnerable groups. To assist them in this task, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) have developed a practical guide for European border guards who first come into contact with people in need of international protection. It was drafted by experts from EU Member States, in close cooperation with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and UNHCR. Frontex also published a manual for border guards and other people working at airports to help spot children who may be victims of trafficking. Border guards play a key role in the detection of any kind of trafficking and in particular in the fight against trafficking in human beings. They contribute to protect potential refugees and all vulnerable persons against those who exploit misery and human distress.
