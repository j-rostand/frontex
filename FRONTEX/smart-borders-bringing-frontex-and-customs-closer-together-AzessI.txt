In his keynote speech to the World Customs
Organization (WCO), Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri spoke about the essential
role of customs authorities for the internal security of the European Union and
beyond, and stressed that increasing travel flows will require even closer
cooperation between the two organisations in future.
People cross the EUâ€™s external borders more
than 600 million times each year and global traveller flows are rising at an
ever increasing rate. By 2025, the number of border crossings into the EU is
expected to grow to almost 900 million, a third of which will be made by non-EU
nationals.
