The number of Syrians detected at the borders in the Western Balkans
region nearly quadrupled to 20 000 in the second quarter compared to the previous
three months. Syrians ranked just ahead of Afghans, whose number nearly tripled
to 18 850.The record number of Syrians and Afghans detected at the Western Balkan
borders is closely linked to the massive inflow of migrants arriving on the
Greek islands from Turkey. The high pressure on the Aegean Islands is later
echoed on the Western Balkan route with a certain time lag, which corresponds
to the time migrants need to organise their onwards movements.In the
April-June period, the number of detections involving African migrants more than
tripled compared to the previous quarter, reaching 4 000. All regions of Africa
contributed to this overall increase, with Congolese, Somalis, Cameroonians and
Nigerians being the top reported nationalities.Meanwhile, the number of detections of citizens of Western Balkan
countries dropped by 83 percent quarter-on-quarter, mainly because of the near
disappearance of Kosovo nationals at the Hungarian border with Serbia. The drop
in the numbers of Kosovo nationals resulted from a concerted measures
undertaken by Kosovo, Serbia, Hungary, Austria and Germany.
More than 2
200 migrants were detected seeking to pass the Western Balkans border crossing points
hidden in vehicles – a six-fold rise from the previous quarter and the highest
number since data collection began. Such a high increase was mainly due to the
surge in detections at the border between Serbia and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Mac­edonia.
