Introduction 
The amended Frontex Regulation in Article 26a mandates that Frontex shall establish a Consultative Forum (CF) and designate a Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO). 
In February 2012, Frontex Management Board (MB) established a Drafting Advisory Committee (DAC) composed of representatives of the Management Board (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the European Commission), joined at a later stage – for the discussion on the Consultative Forum only – by representatives of the partner organisations mentioned in Article 26a of the Regulation (FRA, EASO and UNHCR). The DAC shall advise and guide the Agency in the preparations of the relevant Frontex Management Board Decisions in view of implementing the abovementioned Article. 
Establishment of the Consultative Forum
Article 26a (2) of the Regulation states that Frontex shall establish a Consultative Forum to:
•   assist the Executive Director (ED) and the MB in fundamental rights matters, and
•   be consulted on the further development and implementation of the Fundamental Rights Strategy, Code of Conduct and Common Core Curricula.
The CF will publish a yearly report of its activities.
It is anticipated that there will be two main types of organizations to be invited to participate: (1) civil society organisations, which will represent the majority of participants and (2) International Organizations and EU Agencies specialised in Fundamental Rights issues including those explicitly mentioned in the Regulation.
The MB Decision on the composition of the CF is planned to be adopted on 23 May. 
Designation of the Fundamental Rights Officer
According to Articles 26a (3) of the Regulation, the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) shall have the necessary qualifications and experience in the field of fundamental rights, shall be independent in the performance of his/her duties and shall report directly to the Management Board and the Consultative Forum. The FRO will be designated by the Frontex Management Board.
The vacancy notice will be published shortly, allowing the FRO to take up his/her position before the end of 2012.
