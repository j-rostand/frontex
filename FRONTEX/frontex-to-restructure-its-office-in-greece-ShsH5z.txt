The Frontex Management Board voted today to restructure the
Frontex Liaison Office (FLO) in Piraeus, Greece, by incorporating it into the EU
Regional Task Force, as of January 2016.This will reinforce the existing office while improving cooperation
between Frontex, Europol and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) in
Greece to assist the country in managing the unprecedented migratory pressure
at its external borders.“This change will have no effect on Frontex’s operations in
Greece, where we continue to increase the number of our officers assisting in
registering incoming migrants,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri. “This is good news because it provides a platform for the coordination
between EU agencies on the ground.”
Currently Frontex deploys 325 officers on the Greek islands,
of which 167 are supporting identification and registration of arriving
migrants. The FLO in Piraeus has a staff of five, who will continue working as
part of the EURTF.
