More than 540 000 migrants have arrived on the Greek islands
in the first ten months of the year, which was 13 times more than in the same
period of 2014. Syrians continued to account for the largest number of
arrivals, although in recent weeks the share of Afghan nationals has risen
significantly.Despite the worsening weather conditions in October, more
than 150 000 people made the journey from Turkey to Greece last month compared
to fewer than 8 500 in October 2014.As a direct knock-on effect, in the January-October period
some 500 000 detections of illegal border crossings were recorded on the EU’s
external borders in the Western Balkans, mainly on Hungary’s and Croatia’s borders
with Serbia. Most of the migrants detected in the region had earlier arrived on
one of the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea and then left the EU to travel
through the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. After Hungary
constructed a fence on its border with Serbia and tightened border controls in
September, the migrants have begun crossing Croatia’s border with Serbia in
record numbers.As part of its effort to assist Greece and Western Balkan
states in dealing with the unprecedented migratory pressure, Frontex has
strengthened Operation Poseidon Sea and deployed 114 officers on Lesbos and
other Greek islands to support the local authorities in identifying,
registering and fingerprinting of new arrivals. This includes 37 officers
deployed at the Lesbos hotspot, where Frontex is completing a pilot project of
an accelerated registration process to shorten the waiting time for the
migrants and pave the way for relocation of asylum seekers.Frontex has also offered to increase its presence on the
Greek land borders with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania,
as well as Croatia’s border with Serbia.“We are in close contact with Greece and Croatia to fine
tune the kind of support these EU Member States expect from Frontex,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.In contrast to the record numbers in Greece and the Western
Balkans, the Central Mediterranean route saw the number of people crossing from
Libya to Italy drop by half in October to 8 500 compared to the same month of
2014. This was in large part due to a shortage of boats available to smugglers,
bringing the figure for the first ten months down to 140 000 versus nearly 155
000 in the same period of 2014.
Overall, the number of detections of illegal border
crossings at the EU’s external borders between January and October stood at an
unprecedented 1.2 million, four times the 282 000 recorded in all of last year.
