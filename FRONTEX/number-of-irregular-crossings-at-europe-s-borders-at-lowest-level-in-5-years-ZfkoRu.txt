Last year the number of
illegal border-crossings at Europe’s external borders has fallen by a quarter compared
with 2017 to an estimated 150 000, the lowest level in five years. The
total for 2018 was also 92% below the peak of the migratory crisis in 2015.
The drop was due to the
dramatic fall in the number of migrants taking the Central Mediterranean route
to Italy. The number of detections of irregular crossings on this route plunged
80% compared to 2017 to slightly more than 23 000.
The Central Mediterranean
route saw the smallest number of irregular entries since 2012. The number of
departures from Libya dropped 87% from a year ago, and those from Algeria fell
by nearly a half. Departures from Tunisia stayed roughly unchanged. Tunisians
and Eritreans were the two most represented nationalities on this route,
together accounting for a third of all migrants.
