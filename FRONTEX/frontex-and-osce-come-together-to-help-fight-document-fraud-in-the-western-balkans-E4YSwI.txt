Document fraud is a global challenge for border security,
internal security and migration management. This is why experts from Frontex
and the OSCE organised a conference in Vienna this week to talk about ways to
prevent document fraud in the Western Balkans region.
The meeting brought together document experts from all
around Europe, the European Commission, the European External Action Service,
Europol, Interpol, IOM, as well as representatives from Western Balkan
countries.
The participants discussed ways to coordinate activities to
fight against document fraud and support relevant authorities with training
aimed at detecting this criminal activity. This cooperation should go beyond
law enforcement activities as it requires to establish a relationship with
authorities issuing documents, as well as with international organisations,
airlines, shipping companies and others.
