In the second quarter of 2016, 874 cases of illegal
border-crossing between border crossing-points were reported by the Eastern
Partnership Risk Analysis Network member countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine). More than half of these cases involved
nationals of Eastern Partnership and Community of Independent States countries,
mostly Ukrainians, Russians and Moldovans. Among these, more than four in five
cases were linked to suspected smuggling of illicit goods or other forms of crime
not related to migration.
As regards detections related to irregular migration, the
majority of cases involved nationals of Afghanistan and Vietnam. The number of
people smugglers arrested in the second quarter dropped by nearly 80% from the
previous three months to 45, mainly due to the sharp decrease in migrants
crossing the border from the Russian Federation to Finland.
