Today, Ilkka Laitinen, Frontex Executive Director, and Ferenc Bánfi, CEPOL Director met at CEPOL Secretariat to discuss the strategy for closer future cooperation between Frontex and CEPOL.
Both Directors agreed that any future cooperation should not only build on the arrangement signed by both agencies in June 2009, but also reflect the recent joint report written by CEPOL, Eurojust, Europol and Frontex which outlines how to improve interagency cooperation among the EU law enforcement agencies. 
Initial areas of discussion included cooperation on specific areas of training and the future Exchange Programme.
Ilkka Laitinen said: “Although we have had good cooperation so far endorsed by both agencies, we have aligned our views for the future. Today marks the starting point for more intense and practical cooperation.”
Ferenc Banfi added: “I believe that cooperation with the family of law enforcement agencies is a priority for CEPOL. By merging our efforts we are able to provide added value in building a new security culture and to be more effective in fighting cross-border crime.”
Frontex is the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States.
CEPOL – European Police College brings together senior police officers across Europe with the aim to encourage cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime and maintenance of public security and law and order.
CEPOL and Frontex signed a cooperation arrangement on 24 June 2009.
