The second class of the Frontex Joint Master’s in
Strategic Border Management programme celebrated their graduation at a ceremony
in Riga, Latvia.



The Joint Master’s programme is Europe’s only such
specialised degree. It was developed by the agency, in collaboration with six
partner universities and more than 20 EU border guard training organisations
and academies. The programme aims to promote the highest standards at EU
borders, while protecting and promoting fundamental rights in border
management. 
“We are here to celebrate 24 graduates from 13 countries
representing 19 authorities and organisations, including Frontex and INTERPOL,”
said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Berndt Koerner. “This Master’s programme
helps develop strategic leadership and European cooperation that will support
integrated border management and a common EU border and coast guard culture.”
Over 18 months, the students covered topics including risk
and threat management, innovation and technology related to border management, fundamental
rights and EU borders policies and strategies. The programme consisted of 10
modules delivered by experienced border and coast guard professionals and high
profile academics from 18 countries.
The ceremony took place at the House of Blackheads in Riga and was hosted by Rezekne Academy of Technologies
and the State Border Guard of the Republic of Latvia.
