Warsaw, 16 April, 2013 — Representatives of Frontex and
the border authority of Azerbaijan signed a Working Arrangement today.
Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen represented the Agency in a signing ceremony
with Lieutenant-General Elchin Guliyev, Chief of State Border Service of the
Republic of Azerbaijan, at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw. 
The
Working Arrangement’s chief components include the development of activities in
the field of information exchange and risk analyses, training and
research-and-development  related to
border management as well as the elaboration and coordination of joint
operational measures and pilot projects on border control. Sharing of
experience is also envisaged with a view to developing efficient border-control
procedures, enhanced technical capabilities and exchange of best practices. The
overarching goal of the Working Arrangement is to improve interoperability and
cooperation between the border authorities of EU Member States and Azerbaijan. 
This is the
eighteenth Working Arrangement in place between
Frontex and the authorities of a non-EU country and aims to establish and
gradually develop mutual cooperation on border security-related matters.
