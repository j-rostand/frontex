The third Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis Report (WB ARA 2012) published by Frontex assesses the situation at the common borders between Western Balkan countries and neighbouring EU Member States. 
The analysis shows that the irregular migration flows have further evolved during 2011 with the Slovenian-Croatian border being clearly the busiest EU external land border section. This situation was driven by three main factors: the extension of visa liberalisation for biometric passport holders from Albania and Bosnia   Herzegovina; an increasing numbers of migrants at the Greek-Turkish borders, and an expansion in direct air links between the Western Balkans and Turkey.
