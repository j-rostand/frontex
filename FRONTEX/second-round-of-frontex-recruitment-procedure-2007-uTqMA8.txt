What do we offer?
We offer an interesting career in a multinational environment in the first agency of the European Union established in a new Member State. Our staff is composed of citizens of almost all EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries.  Being a body of the European Union, we will enable you to gain added value to your national experience by supplementing it with a Community aspect. Besides, the fact that FRONTEX is still at its initial stage of existence gives us the challenging chance to contribute to the development of this body with new ideas. 
 
FRONTEX applies an equal opportunities policy and accepts applications without distinction on grounds of age, race, political, philosophical or religious conviction, sex or sexual orientation and regardless of disabilities, marital status or family situation.
 
Who do we seek?We seek motivated staff members primarily with professional experience corresponding with the tasks of FRONTEX, including among others experts from border guard services, national police bodies or law enforcement bodies. Besides, analysts will be needed as risk analysis creates the basis for all our activities, not to forget staff for training and research and development activities.  Join us! We are looking for new staff members offering positions as Temporary and Contract Agents.
