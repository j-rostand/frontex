The first European Dog Handlers Show, open to the wide audience, took place last Saturday in Oradea (Romania). Seventeen team from all across European Union performed joint exercises based on real case scenarios. During the show, dog handlers tested the common dog training standards developed in the Frontex Dog Handlers Manual.
The manual is a curriculum focusing on four specific areas such as standards for selection of dogs and dog handlers, dog handlers training, dog training and common terminology.
The aim of setting common standards for service dogs is to make the cooperation between teams from different countries more effective during joint operations coordinated by Frontex. Border guards working together at the external EU borders need to act in a coordinated manner and speak the same language.
During the show teams presented impressive skills of service dogs which include detection of drugs and explosives, violence control and obedience.
The show was an excellent occasion for the wide public to get more familiar with the work of border guards officers and their dogs, which can not be seen on a daily basis. It was also a great opportunity for European dog handlers to work together, exchange information and experiences in the field of dog training.
