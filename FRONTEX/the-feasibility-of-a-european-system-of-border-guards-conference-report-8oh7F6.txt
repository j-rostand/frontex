The final report
of the Conference ‘The Feasibility of a European System of Border Guards: A
Practitioner’s Perspective’ was compiled by rapporteurs Dr Peter Hobbing and Mr
Emilio De Capitani. The report is based on a conference held in Warsaw in
October last year and constitutes a practitioners’ input to the ongoing
discussion on the future of the justice and home affairs (JHA) area. The report
has been shared with the European Commission, European Parliament and Council.The ESBG
Conference, co-organised by Frontex and the Academy of European Law (ERA), took place in Warsaw on the 28-29 October with the main
objective of brainstorming on the feasibility of an ESBG as referred to in the
Stockholm Programme, the five-year JHA framework that expires in 2014. The
discussions focused on aspects of border management including operations,
capacities and interagency cooperation as well as a number of key legislative
developments and legal aspects related to the issue.  
The findings and
main recommendations demonstrate the importance of reassessing cooperation and
coordination needs, not only among national border management authorities but
also among other EU, national or third country actors playing critical roles in
home affairs policies. Such an assessment should necessarily lead to the
drafting of an EU integrated border management strategy aimed at more
consistent EU and national actions when implementing a common border management
policy heavily reliant on mutual trust and solidarity among the member states.
