Last week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, 
opened the first “Risk Analysis Cell” in Niamey in cooperation with 
Nigerien authorities. The role of these cells, which are run 
by local analysts trained by Frontex, is to collect and analyse 
strategic data on cross-border crime in various African countries and 
support relevant authorities involved in border management. This
 data includes information on illegal border crossings, document fraud, 
trafficking in human beings and other types of cross-border crime. It is
 shared with authorities at national and regional level to produce 
analysis and policy recommendations, as well as with Frontex.
