 signed by Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri and General Petro Tsygykal,
 Head of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.The two
 met in Arlamow, Poland, during the annual European Border and Coast Guard Day organised
 by Frontex.
“We are celebrating the work of European border and coast guard officers only a few kilometres from
 the border with Ukraine because it is
 an important partner for Frontex. Working together with our neighbours 
is crucial to tackle cross-border challenges,” said Frontex Director
