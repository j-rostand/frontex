Frontex
welcomes today’s vote by the European Parliament on the regulation that will
create the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the foundation laid by Frontex,
which has helped to coordinate cooperation at the EU’s external borders for
more than a decade.“I am
very pleased about today’s vote by the Parliament. While the new regulation
still has to be approved by the Council of the European Union, we have already
started intensive preparations for its implementation,” said Frontex Executive
Director Fabrice Leggeri. The key
goals for the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency are to: ensure the
implementation of integrated border management at EU level, oversee an
effective functioning of border control at the external borders, provide
increased operational and technical assistance to EU Member States, support
search and rescue operations and play an enhanced role in returns. The
text of the regulation must be translated into all EU official languages before
the European Parliament votes on the final version. The last step is the
adoption of the document by the Council of the EU and publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union. 
 “The transition from Frontex into the European
Border and Coast Guard Agency will be a gradual one – some of the tasks
proposed in the text of the regulation are new, while others constitute an
expansion of the existing ones. This means that some elements can be implemented
quickly, while others require more time. I must stress that we are not alone in
the implementation of this regulation – we have to work closely with a wide
range of partners including border and coast guard authorities in the EU Member
States, other EU agencies as well as non-EU countries. We have a tremendous
task ahead of us,” Leggeri said.
