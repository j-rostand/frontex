The
Management Board of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, met in
Warsaw with partners from the Western Balkan countries to discuss joint strategies to address migration and security
challenges in the region. 

The
participants, who included chiefs of the border authorities of Albania, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia spoke about how Frontex, the Western Balkans and EU Member States can
together improve their ability to track
migratory flows and related criminal activities, and how to align border
management systems in the region with EU’s policies and practices. 
“This is the first time the
Management Board of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is meeting with
partners from outside of the EU to discuss cooperation,” said the Chair of the
Frontex Management Board, Marko Gašperlin. 
Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri added that “common challenges in the key region of the Western Balkans
require a joint response. We can only effectively tackle many challenges at our
borders if we work together across borders.”
