Frontex will hold a Conference and Exhibition on Biometrics on the move technology for border management on 28-29 September 2017 in Warsaw, Poland.Aim and scopeThe objective of the conference is to provide a platform for international dialogue on the feasibility and potential impact of ‘on the move technology’ for border control with a view to enhancing security and facilitating travel at the borders.

We therefore invite academic researchers and technology providers as well as consultants to submit an extended abstract of original work on research, innovations and future concepts in the field of biometrics on the move technology.A paper can be presented orally or as a poster to be displayed within the conference exhibition. Topics of interestTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:Innovative and future concepts for border controlIdentity management and authentication on the moveOn-the-move technology and its impact on the future of border controlVulnerabilities and risk managementBiometrics on the move and performance assessmentIntegration of information systemsData protection, societal aspects and user perceptionTechnology, innovations and developmentTechnology roadmap and implementation strategiesPaper submission and selectionExtended abstracts should be up to four pages long (including references), written in English and submitted to bom-conference@frontex.europa.eu with subject line “Call for Extended Abstracts”.
