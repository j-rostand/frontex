Frontex has called on the authorities of EU Member States
and Schengen Associated Countries to contribute an additional 269 officers to
help screen, fingerprint and register migrants at the European Union’s external
borders.Member States have so far agreed to provide 320 officers to
help at the external borders most affected by the unprecedented migratory flows
this year, mainly in Greece.Frontex has already strengthened Operation Poseidon Sea and
deployed 133 officers on Lesbos and other Greek islands to support the local
authorities in identifying, registering and fingerprinting of new arrivals.
This includes 55 officers deployed at the Lesbos hotspot, where Frontex is
completing a pilot project of an accelerated registration process to shorten
the waiting time for the migrants and pave the way for relocation of asylum
seekers.Frontex has also offered to increase its presence on the
Greek land borders with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania,
as well as Croatia’s border with Serbia.“Considering the critical situation we are facing and the
large number of officers requested by Frontex to be deployed I decided that we
can have a flexible approach to the types of officers and experts we are asking
for,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.“These officers may not necessarily come from the border
police, but also from migration or other law enforcement related bodies,” he
added.
More than 540 000 migrants have arrived on the Greek islands
in the first ten months of the year, which was 13 times more than in the same
period of 2014. As a direct knock-on effect, some 500 000 detections of illegal
border crossings were recorded on the EU’s external borders in the Western
Balkans, mainly on Hungary’s and Croatia’s borders with Serbia.
