Frontex, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and
the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) signed bilateral interagency
agreements today to extend their cooperation. The three agencies will continue
to work together in their respective areas of border surveillance, interception
of vessels suspected of engaging in criminal activities, cross border crime, support
for search and rescue at sea and illegal fishing.
