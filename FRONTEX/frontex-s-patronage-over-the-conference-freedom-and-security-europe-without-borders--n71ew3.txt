Discussion on Integrated Border Management, illegal migration flows to the EU and cooperation of Frontex with private sector will be one of issues discussed during the „Europe Without Borders” conference. Frontex decided to take the conference, organised by Computerworld weekly, under its wings in order to present the European approach to the concept of border management. Two representatives of Frontex will deliver presentations on integrated border management and public-private partnership. The Conference will be held in Serock (Poland) 18-20 April.
You can find details on the Computerworld webiste.
Frontex promotes a pan European model of Integrated Border Security, which consists not only of border controls but also other important elements. Exchange of information and cooperation between Member States, immigration and repatriation form the first tier of the model. The second tier is represented by border and customs control including surveillance, border checks and risk analysis followed by cooperation with border guards, customs and police authorities in neighbouring countries which forms the third entity. The last part is connected with cooperation with third countries including common activities.
