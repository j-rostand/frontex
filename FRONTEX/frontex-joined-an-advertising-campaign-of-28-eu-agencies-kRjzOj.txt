Frontex joined an advertising campaign of 28 EU Agencies. These specialised bodies are an answer to a desire for geographical devolution and the need to cope with new tasks of legal, technical and/or scientific nature. Working throughout Europe in various fields, with more than 2 500 staff and significant budgetary resources, the agencies and their activities have become an essential part of the EU and play a key role in the implementation of its policies. The self-explanatory slogan of this campaign "Whatever you do, we work for you" is the message send to all EU citizens, aiming at raising the profile of the Agencies across Europe. Each agency is unique and fulfils an individual function. Some react to the need to develop scientific or technical know-how in certain fields, other bring together different interest groups to facilitate dialogue at European and international levels. European Commission President José Manuel Barroso underlined the central role of the decentralised EU agencies at a meeting earlier this year: “The agencies are our satellites – picking up signals on the ground, processing them, and beaming them back and forth. Through their activities the agencies contribute to making ´Europe´ closer to the European citizens and hopefully easier to understand, and I consider this as being of utmost importance”.
