Frontex initiated yesterday the deployment of 293 officers and 15
vessels to the Greek islands as part of a new operation called Poseidon Rapid
Intervention after Greece requested additional assistance at its external
borders in the Aegean earlier this month. Poseidon Rapid Intervention replaces the Joint Operation Poseidon
Sea with a higher number of officers who will assist in identifying and
fingerprinting of arriving migrants, along with interpreters and forged
document experts. Poseidon Rapid Intervention aims to provide Greece with
additional technical assistance aiming to strengthen its border surveillance,
registration and identification capacity.In accordance with the Frontex Regulation, at the request of a
Member State faced with a situation of urgent and exceptional migratory
pressure at its external borders, Frontex may deploy European Border Guard
Teams for a limited period on the territory of the requesting Member State. It
should be noted that while participation in Frontex Joint Operations is
voluntary, Member States are obliged to send border guards for rapid
operational assistance deployments, unless they themselves face an exceptional
situation substantially affecting the discharge of national tasks.
The number of border guards deployed will gradually increase to
over 400 officers as well as additional vessels, vehicles and other technical
equipment to assist the national authorities in the management of the
unprecedented migratory pressure at the Greek external borders.
