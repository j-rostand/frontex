Warsaw, 18 December 2013 — Frontex and Eurojust signed a Memorandum of
Understanding today at Frontex’s Warsaw HQ. Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen
represented the Agency in a signing ceremony with Michèle Coninsx, the
President of Eurojust. The Memorandum aims to enhance cooperation between the
two agencies focusing on the fight against serious cross-border crime such as
trafficking in human beings and smuggling.According to the Memorandum of Understanding, the cooperation between the
two Agencies will be enhanced by exchange information on trends and challenges related
to serious cross- border crime. Development of joint training courses to
encourage cooperation in the fight against organised crime and sharing best
practices in areas of common interest is also envisaged. “Addressing serious crimes such as trafficking in human beings and
smuggling in a coordinated manner is a priority in the EU,” said Frontex
Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen.  “Frontex
and Eurojust have already worked together on programmes that help border guards
identify potential victims of trafficking in human beings.”
Combating trafficking in human beings was also the subject of a Joint
Statement signed by all EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies, including
Eurojust and Frontex, in 2011. The Memorandum of Understanding signed today is
the next step in that process.
