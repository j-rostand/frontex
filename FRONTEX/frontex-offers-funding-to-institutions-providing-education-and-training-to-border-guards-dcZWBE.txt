Today Frontex published a call for proposals for National
Integration of Sectoral Qualifications Framework (SQF) through curriculum
development, review and accreditation at national level. 

The SQF is a framework of knowledge,
skills and professional competences for all types
of border guard activities across the EU. The
SQF encompasses all levels of qualifications required in vocational and
academic education and training for border guards.


Successful applicants will work together with international
experts to develop new educational programmes for European border guards or
review the existing ones in line with Bologna/Copenhagen principles (which
facilitate mobility and exchange of students and teachers in the EU) and align
them with the SQF. The process will be monitored and supported by Frontex
experts.

Individual projects may receive up to 30,000 EUR
contribution from Frontex. The deadline for submitting applications is 30
September 2016.
