Today, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) have agreed
to work together to establish fundamental rights
monitors, design their training programme and integrate them into Frontex
activities.
“The
establishment of the new monitors is another step to make our activities even
more transparent and promote fundamental rights throughout all our activities. We
are committed to ensuring the highest standards in all that we do. And Fundamental
rights are an essential component of effective border management.” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. “The Fundamental Rights Agency is a key
partner for us in this task,” he added.
"It is essential that
the EU, its Member States and agencies do their utmost to protect people's
fundamental rights. Fundamental rights monitoring of operations at the land and
sea borders can help ensure that rights violations do not occur. The
fundamental rights monitors are an important preventive tool and FRA will
provide its fundamental rights expertise to help establish them. The vacancy
notices should be published as soon as possible so the monitors can be deployed,"
said FRA's director Michael O'Flaherty.
