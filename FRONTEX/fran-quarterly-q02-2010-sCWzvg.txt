Frontex Risk Analysis Netwrork (FRAN) report provides a regular overview of illegal migration at the EU external borders.
The tenth issue of the FRAN Quarterly, focusing on the situation between April and June 2010, is based on data and information provided by 30 FRAN Member Statesâ€™ border-control authorities within the framework of the FRAN. The report is mostly based on a statistical analysis of monthly data on six indicators of illegal migration and one on asylum. Where possible, other information collected by RAU (for instance during joint operations) was used.
There is a general decline in illegal migration to the EU compared to a year ago. Turkey is the main transit country for illegal migration to the EU, particularly for nationals from Afghanistan. In the Eastern Mediterranean route, there has been a gradual and recently intensified shift from the Greek-Turkish sea border to the land border, with the region of Orestiada being under the biggest pressure. Air connections to Turkey are increasingly used by migrants from North Africa, who then illegally cross the EU external border with Turkey.
