On 27 June, Frontex established a basis for cooperation with the International Center for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) via an exchange of letters between Ilkka Laitinen, the Executive Director of Frontex and Gottfried Zurcher, Director General of ICMPD.“The aim of the agreement is to enhance cooperation between the two organizations in the promotion, development and implementation of integrated border management projects in EU Member States and Third Countries” - said Ilkka Laitinen.
The two organisations will focus on improving the management of migratory flows via cooperation in the field of training, research and capacity-building activities for the border guards of EU Member States or those of third countries. 
Frontex already exchanges information and analyses in the fight against trafficking in human beings with law enforcement agencies such as Europol. Co-operation in this field is also being extended to Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and a number of relevant EU Council bodies.
