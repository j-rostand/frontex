Today the European
Border and Coast Guard Agency is being officially launched, less than a year
after it was first proposed by the European Commission. The launch event takes place at
the Kapitan Andreevo Border Checkpoint at the Bulgarian external border with
Turkey and includes a presentation of the vehicles, equipment and teams of the
new Agency, as well as a press conference attended by Migration, Home Affairs and
Citizenship Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko
Borissov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior of Bulgaria Rumiana
Bachvarova, State Secretary of the Interior Ministry of the Slovak Republic
Denisa Sakova, Executive Director of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency
Fabrice Leggeri, EU interior ministers and other senior officials. Building on
the foundations of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will closely
monitor the EU's external borders and work together with Member States to
quickly identify and address any potential security threats to the EU's
external borders.
