In the third quarter of 2015, 1 866 cases of illegal
border-crossings were recorded at the EU’s eastern borders, a third more than
in the previous three-month period. Nationals from outside of the CIS and EaP
region – mainly citizens of Afghanistan, Vietnam and Syria – accounted for 51%
of the detections. Ukrainians accounted for the largest number of illegal
border-crossings, but they were mainly linked to smuggling and other reasons
not related to irregular migration.
