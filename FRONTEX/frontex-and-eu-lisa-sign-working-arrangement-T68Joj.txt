Warsaw, 31 January 2014 — Frontex
and the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems
(eu-LISA) signed a Working Arrangement today at Frontex headquarters in Warsaw.
Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen represented the
Agency in a signing ceremony with Krum Garkov, the Executive Director of
eu-LISA. The areas of cooperation covered by the document include training, such as
development of e-learning tools, ICT-related projects and exchange of
information. For example the arrangements will be developed for eu-LISA to provide Frontex with statistical, anonymous
data outputs from the large-scale IT systems, which will enhance situational
awareness at the external borders and be a useful tool for risk analysis. In
return Frontex feedback will support eu-LISA in further developing and refining
these services for Frontex, which will be of benefit to the wider EU border
management community. “Both Agencies have a
lot in common, not only because we are part of the EU and of the Home Affairs family,
but mainly because we work for almost the same national stakeholders,” said
Ilkka Laitinen. “We complement each other providing respectively the ICT and
business expertise for national border security agencies.” 
The common objective of Frontex and eu-LISA is to help border guards
achieve a high level of skills and develop common training standards, in
particular for the use of large-scale IT systems such as the Schengen Information
System II (SIS II), Visa Information System (VIS) or Eurodac.
