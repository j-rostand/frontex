Today, a three-week basic course in maritime operations,
search and rescue and law enforcement organised by Frontex, the European Border
and Coast Guard Agency; Italian authorities and the EU Border Assistance
Mission in Libya (EUBAM) was completed. Twenty one officers from
Libya’s General Administration for Coastal Security (GACS) attended
the training. 
The course took place at the School of Guardia
di Finanza in Ostia, Italy. 
Among its many components were search and rescue (with
the assistance of Italy’s Guardia Costiera) and first aid for non-medical
staff. The protection of fundamental rights was highlighted throughout the
course and was the subject of a dedicated lesson. The contents of the course
were reviewed by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International
Organization for Migration (IOM).
