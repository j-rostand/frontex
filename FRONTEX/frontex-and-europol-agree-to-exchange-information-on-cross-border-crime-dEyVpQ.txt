The heads of Frontex and Europol signed an agreement today to
expand their cooperation in combatting cross-border criminal activities by
exchanging information, including personal data of suspected criminals, and
jointly planning operational activities.“The new agreement represents a significant
step forward in our cooperation, which is needed now more than ever as Europe
grapples with various criminal activities linked to its external borders, along
with the threat of terrorism,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.Executive Director Leggeri and
Europol Director Rob Wainwright signed the agreement during a ceremony in
Brussels. Also taking part were Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos and President of the General Affairs Council, Luxembourg's Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Jean Asselborn.Under the new agreement, Frontex
will be able to send personal data of suspected criminals to Europol. The transfer of personal data will be
limited to information gathered by Member States during operations coordinated
by Frontex about people suspected of being involved in cross-border criminal
activities.Frontex and Europol also agreed to cooperate in the
planning and implementation of operational activities towards the common
objective of preventing and combatting cross border criminal activities. The
agencies will share strategic and operational information.This agreement replaces the strategic cooperation agreement
of 2008. The agencies contribute to each other’s projects, and in particular to
each other’s risk/threat assessments and also exchange media monitoring reports
and products on a regular basis.Frontex and Europol, along with EASO and Eurojust, have
jointly developed the concept of European Regional Task Force (EURTF) – a
shared office where the representatives of these agencies work together to
coordinate the EU assistance to the national authorities facing massive
migratory pressure. They assist in the identification, registration and return
as well as criminal investigations of people-smuggling networks which takes
place either in the ports or in specific reception centres.
An EURTF office in Catania, Sicily, was opened in June 2015
and one in Piraeus, Greece, is expected to become operational in January 2016.
