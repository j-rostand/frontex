the General Inspectorate of Border Police of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, signed a cooperation plan for the

arrangement signed in 2008, paves the way for improved exchange of

 border crime and initiatives to support technical assistance to the 
Moldovan authorities.
