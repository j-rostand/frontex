The detections of illegal border-crossing
at EU’s external borders dropped by more than half in the second quarter
compared with the same period of 2015. The majority of migrants were detected
on the Central Mediterranean route, where more than 51 000 migrants were
rescued in international waters and brought to Italy.
On this route, three out of every four
migrants departed from Libya, although the share of migrants who set out from
Egypt increased to 14%. There were also more departures from Tunisia and
Algeria.
Departures from Libya were dominated by
migrants from West Africa, especially Nigerians. The Egyptian route was used by
migrants from the Horn of Africa, mostly Eritreans and Egyptians.
The Eastern Mediterranean sea route from
Turkey to Greece was the second most common entry point to Europe in the second
quarter, with some 7 000 arrivals on the Aegean Islands. This represented
a 95% drop in comparison with the first three months of this year, when 151 000
of migrants arrived on this route.
The number of irregular border-crossings on
the Western Balkan route, mostly a secondary route for migrants who originally
arrived in Greece, decreased by 90% between the first and second quarter of
2016 and amounted to 11 000. Afghans accounted for the largest share of
the detections. 
Between April and July the number of
arrested people-smugglers increased by almost 20% to about 3 500, most of
them being arrested in Spain.
FRAN Quarterly reports are prepared by the
Frontex Risk Analysis Unit to provide a regular overview of irregular migration
at the EU’s external borders, based on the irregular migration data exchanged
among Member State border-control authorities.
