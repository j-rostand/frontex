This week, Frontex launched discussions with industry representatives
about a possible use of remote piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) for maritime border
surveillance and the potential for industry to provide these kinds of services
to Frontex.While at the moment there is no European legislation that
allows the use of remotely piloted aircraft  in shared airspace, the preliminary
discussions were meant to explore the feasibility of extending the pool of
assets providing aerial surveillance services to include medium altitude long endurance
RPAS.In a one-day workshop, Frontex met six leading vendors and operators
of RPAS to inform them about how the agency would consider using such systems
at Europe’s external borders. The discussions allowed Frontex to better
understand various issues related to the potential use of such surveillance
services.
Frontex plans to conduct first trials of the RPAS in
operational scenarios later this year.
