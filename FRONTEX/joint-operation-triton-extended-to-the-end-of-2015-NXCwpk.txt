Frontex has extended Joint Operation
Triton in the Central Mediterranean until the end of 2015 to continue
supporting Italy at its maritime borders and help save the lives of
migrants stranded at sea.
 “All vessels and aircraft taking
part in operation Triton actively contribute to the detection and
rescue of people in distress and will now continue to do so for the
rest of this year,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice
Leggeri.
Since the launch of Joint Operation
Triton on 1 November 2014, nearly 22,300 migrants have been saved,
including more than 7,000 with the direct participation of vessels
and aircraft taking part in the operation. Most of the search and
rescue takes place in the international waters some 40 NM off the
Libyan coast.
