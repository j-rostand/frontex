Last week, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri visited the Spanish National Coordination Centre in Madrid, where he discussed cooperation with the Spanish authorities in combatting cross-border crime and dealing with migratory pressure at Spain’s external borders.During his visit to Spain, Fabrice Leggeri also met with the Director of the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), Pascal Legai, to discuss ongoing cooperation between the two EU agencies. Frontex and SatCen work closely together to provide border authorities in the EU with analysed satellite imagery and geospatial information to help ensure border security at Europe’s sea.Frontex currently deploys 69 officers in Spain, along with one vessel and one aircraft as part of Operation Indalo. The border guard officers, vessels and aircraft deployed by the agency in Spain have been assisting the Spanish authorities with border surveillance and search and rescue. Frontex vessels and aircraft are also involved in fighting drug smuggling operations.The Western Mediterranean sea route has been a major conduit for drug smugglers seeking to bring hashish, cannabis and cocaine to the lucrative European markets. Last year in its operations in Spain, Frontex assisted in seizing 42 tonnes of drugs and arresting 41 people smugglers.
