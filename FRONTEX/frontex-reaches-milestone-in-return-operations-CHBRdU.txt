Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, continues to expand
 its capacity to support EU Member States in returns after launching the
 European Centre for Returns earlier this year.Â In the first 
half of 2018, Frontex has coordinated and co-financed 165 return 
operations by charter flights, returning nearly 6400 non-EU nationals to
 non-EU countries.
