Frontex will strengthen its existing operation on the Greek islands in the Aegean and will assist in the registration and fingerprinting of migrants at Greek land borders with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. It will also reinforce its presence at Croatia’s border with Serbia. “Frontex will launch additional operations in Greece, Croatia and Bulgaria to manage the EU external borders in a more coordinated manner. The agency stands ready to help EU Member States to manage these unprecedented migration flows together,” said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.“The identification of migrants, in which Frontex plays a key role, is a crucial step in helping to speed up access to asylum for all people in need of protection,” Leggeri added.So far this year, more than 480 000 migrants have arrived on the Greek islands in the Aegean.Frontex is already taking an active part in the implementation of the “hotspot” approach in Greece. Its main objective is to pave the way for the relocation of expected asylum seekers.Frontex had anticipated the increased needs for additional activities earlier in October when it asked EU Member States and Schengen Associated Countries to provide 775 border guards, including 610 for operations in Greece and 105 for new land operations in the Western Balkans region. So far, Member States have agreed to provide 326 officers. “I am grateful to Member States for the officers they have already provided. But I have to be clear that the numbers we have asked for are the necessary pre-condition for Frontex to be able to expand its operations,” said Fabrice Leggeri.
