its expertise in the area of border security research and innovation to assist the
European Commission in supporting the development of state of the art technology
for the border and coast guard community.

EU-funded security research enables innovation in
technologies and knowledge that is crucial for developing capabilities to
address today’s security challenges and to anticipate tomorrow’s threats and
opportunities. 
Over the last 15 years, Frontex has developed expertise in the
area of integrated border management research and innovation, which will allow
the Agency to assist the Commission in evaluating research and innovation
results to improve border security, including improved maritime border
protection.
Frontex will contribute to the
effective implementation of relevant parts of the Framework Programmes for
Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe).The Horizon 2020 Work
Programme 2018-2020 for Secure Societies plans an indicative budget of EUR 118
million of EU grants for research projects under research topics in the area of
“Border and External Security”.
