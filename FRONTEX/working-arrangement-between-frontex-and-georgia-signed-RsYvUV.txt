Today in Warsaw, the Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen and the Deputy Minister of Interior of Georgia Zaza Gogava signed a working arrangement establishing operational cooperation between the agency and Georgian Border Police.
“The signing of this arrangement is an important step towards working together to improve border security and combat the phenomenon of illegal migration” - said Ilkka Laitinen.
“This can only be achieved through cooperation between the EU member states and other countries. We hope that by signing of this document, we contribute to improvement of the operational operability between the border guard organisations of the EU member states and Gorgia” – he added.
The working arrangement covers such elements as information exchange, risk analysis, training, research and development, and coordination of joint operational measures.
It will also enable the Gorgian Border Police to benefit from Frontex training tools such as the Common Core Curriculum for basic border guard and forgery detection training. Frontex will finance Georgia's participation in these activities as well its involvement in joint operations coordinated by the agency.
