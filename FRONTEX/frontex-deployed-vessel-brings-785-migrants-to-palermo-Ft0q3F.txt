A Frontex-deployed Norwegian vessel brought 785 migrants
to the port of Palermo, Italy, on Saturday morning after three Italian coast
guard vessels rescued them from a wooden boat and a rubber dinghy off the
Libyan coast on Thursday. 
Siem
Pilot, an 88-metre
long offshore supply vessel is taking
part in the Frontex-coordinated Operation Triton in the Central Mediterranean.
Among the rescued migrants there were 133 women and 27
children. Members of the crew gave plush toys, which they brought from Norway,
to the children aboard. 
“Some members of the crew spoke to their own kids at home
to see what they can do to help the migrant children our ship would rescue.
Together they decided to bring teddy bears. There’s plenty of them in Norway
and these kids need to feel like real children,” said Erling Olstad, commander
of Siem Pilot. 
Most of the migrants said they came from Eritrea. On the
way to Italy, the crew helped 30 migrants who required medical attention. 
Olstad and his crew took part in five search and rescue
operations since Siem Pilot joined Operation
Triton three weeks ago. During one of the earlier rescues, the crew gave
medical treatment to some 20 women who received chemical burns from a mixture
of gasoline and seawater while they were sitting in their rubber dinghy in the
hot sun.
Last week, more than 6 100 migrants were saved off the
coast of Libya. Since the start of the year, some 81 500 migrants have been
rescued in the Central Mediterranean, with one in four saved with the
participation of vessels and aircraft deployed by Frontex.
