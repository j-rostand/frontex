Frontex
has published a call for proposals for "Development and delivery of
training activities for border and coast guards". 

The
objective of the call is to support Member States in their efforts to improve
the knowledge, skills and competences of the border and coast guards. The
proposed training activities should facilitate harmonisation of border and
coast guard education and training and foster cooperation between Member States
and / or non-EU countries, and thus contribute to building interoperability. 
Groups
of entities can jointly develop training courses and/or mobility and exchange
programmes in accordance with European standards, which include common core
curricula developed by Frontex and the Sectoral Qualifications Framework for
Border Guarding. The proposed projects should respond to training needs and
enhance quality and innovation in education and training of border and coast
guards. Frontex will monitor the implementation of the projects.
Projects
may receive up to EUR 60 000 contribution from Frontex. The deadline for
submitting applications is 28 June 2019.
The
relevant documentation is available at http://frontex.europa.eu/about-frontex/grants/
An online information
session about how entities can apply to this call is scheduled for 16
May 2019 at 14:30 CET. In order to register for the webinar please
