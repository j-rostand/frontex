Frontexâ€™s second Western Balkans Annual Risk Analysis (WB ARA) is now available. It was developed in cooperation with the Western Balkan Risk Analysis Network (WB-RAN) comprising the Risk Analysis Units of the competent border-control authorities of: 
- Albania,
- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH),
- Croatia,
- the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (fYROM),

The analysis focuses mainly on irregular migration and is structured around the following elements: (1) a description of the situation at common borders through a set of six indicators on irregular migration, (2) update on different distinctive irregular migration flows, impacting both the area of the Western Balkans and Member States, (3) in-depth description of misuse of visa liberalization throughout 2010, and (4) forecasts for 2012 based on factors likely to influence irregular migration in the area of the Western Balkans and the EU. The statistical annex of the WB ARA includes summary tables, describing the six indicators in detail.
