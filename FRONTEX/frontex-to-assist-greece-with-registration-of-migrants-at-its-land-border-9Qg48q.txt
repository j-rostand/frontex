Frontex agreed with Greece today to expand its activities to
the country’s border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the
agency will assist with registration of migrants. The deployment of additional officers will begin
next week.A joint field visit conducted by the Greek authorities and
Frontex will take place as soon as possible in order to work out the technical details
of the deployment.“It is crucial that all migrants entering the European Union
are properly registered. Migrants at Greece’s northern border will be checked
and those found not properly identified will be registered,” said Frontex
Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri.The strengthening of Frontex’s existing operation on the
Greek islands and assistance in the registration and fingerprinting of migrants
at Greece’s land borders were among the conclusions of the Western Balkans Route
Leaders’ Summit in October.Frontex is already assisting the Greek authorities in
identifying and registering incoming migrants.  The agency currently has 195 officers on the
Aegean islands most affected by migratory flows, identifying migrants and
collecting intelligence about people smuggling networks. Just in the hotspot on
Lesbos, Frontex currently deploys 83 officers.
In October, Frontex called on Member States to provide 775
border guards for its activities, with 600 to be deployed in Greece. Member
States have so far offered 447 officers.
