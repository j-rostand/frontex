The 32
officers deployed by Frontex on the Greek island of Chios have been unable to
work at the registration facility there because of concerns of possible asbestos
contamination in the building.The
Greek authorities have located the Chios registration facilities in Tabakika
inside an old factory which has a roof that contains asbestos. Due to concerns
of contamination, the screening, debriefing, fingerprint experts as well as
interpreters deployed by Frontex have been banned from working there.“Frontex
is responsible for the health and safety of the officers deployed in our
operations. We cannot let them work for many hours every day in the current
registration facility on Chios until we are assured that there is no danger
from a possible asbestos contamination,” said Frontex Executive Director
Fabrice Leggeri.
“Frontex
stands ready to resume registration activities as soon as we are provided with adequate
facilities or new tests determine that the air inside the facilities is not
contaminated,” he added.
