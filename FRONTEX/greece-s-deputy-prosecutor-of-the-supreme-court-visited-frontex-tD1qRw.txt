Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri met last week
with Georgios Pantelis, Deputy Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court in Greece, at the
Frontex headquarters in Warsaw. During the meeting, the two discussed the
potential contribution from Frontex maritime operations to Greek investigations
of criminal networks.Mr. Pantelis was in Warsaw to take part in the European
Patrol Network (EPN) general meeting.Frontex has contributed to national investigations of
criminal smuggling networks by proving information about their activities
gathered by debriefing officers during interviews with migrants arriving at the
European Unionâ€™s external borders.
The EPN brings together border authorities to share
experiences and best practices related to maritime border control, as well as
to strengthen networking and international cooperation. It also contributes to
EU coast guard capacity development.
