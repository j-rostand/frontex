Italian Guardia di Finanza vessels taking part in the
Frontex-coordinated Operation Triton intercepted a cargo ship Munzur carrying 13 tonnes of hashish
north of Italy’s Pantelleria Island on Wednesday. The 80-metre cargo ship,
which was flying a Panamanian flag, was being monitored by Italian authorities
with the support of the Eurosur Fusion Services provided by Frontex.During an inspection, Guardia di Finanza officers found some
500 packages of hashish aboard Munzur
with a combined weight of some 13 tonnes. The boat was taken to the Italian
port of Palermo.Both vessels taking part in the operation were co-financed
by Frontex.So far this year, more than 100 tonnes of drugs were seized
during Frontex-coordinated maritime operations.Tracking data collected by Frontex also helped the Italian
authorities to keep track of Munzur’s location.

The Eurosur Fusion Services use optical and radar satellite technology
to help locate vessels suspected of being engaged in cross border crime.
