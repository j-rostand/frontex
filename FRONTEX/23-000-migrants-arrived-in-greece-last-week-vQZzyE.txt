More than 23 000 migrants arrived in Greece by sea last
week, nearly 50 percent more than in the previous week, according to preliminary
data collected by Frontex. In the Frontex-coordinated Operation Triton in the Central
Mediterranean, 5 400 were rescued last week, roughly in line with the previous
one. There were also 55 bodies recovered in the seven-day period, mainly those
from below the deck of a wooden boat intercepted by Swedish vessel Poseidon.“This was a very dark week. We are deeply saddened by the
deaths of migrants near the Libyan shore and in the lorry in Austria,” said
Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. “Frontex will continue to do all it
can in the areas of its operations to save as many lives as possible. But it is
clear that we go against traffickers who are clearly not concerned with
offering a safe passage. They are ruthless and will do anything for profit.”On the Hungarian border with Serbia, authorities detected some 9
400 migrants last week. 
The figures are based on preliminary data and may change.
