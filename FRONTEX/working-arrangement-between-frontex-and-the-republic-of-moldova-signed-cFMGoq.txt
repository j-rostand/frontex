Today in Chisinau, Moldova, the Frontex Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen and the General Director of the Border Guard Service of the Republic of Moldova Igor Colenov signed a working arrangement establishing operational cooperation.
 
“The signing of this arrangement is an important step towards working together to improve border security and combat the phenomenon of illegal migration” - said Ilkka Laitinen.
 
“This can only be achieved through real cooperation between the EU member states and other countries. Close cooperation between Frontex and the Republic of Moldova is crucial to achieve this aim” – he added.
 
The working arrangement covers such elements as information exchange, risk analysis, training, research and development, and coordination of joint operational measures.
 
It will also enable the Moldovan Border Guard Service to benefit from Frontex training tools such as the Common Core Curriculum for basic border guard and forgery detection training.
 
The Republic of Moldova will also be involved in the Frontex Risk Analysis Network (FRAN). Frontex will finance Moldova's participation in these activities as well its involvement in joint operations.
