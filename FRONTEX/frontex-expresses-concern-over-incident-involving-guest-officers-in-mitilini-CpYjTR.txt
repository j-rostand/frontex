Frontex has written to the national authority of the five border guard officers involved in an incident in Mitilini, Lesvos to express its concern at their off-duty behaviour.  The officers, who had been seconded to Frontex joint operation POSEIDON 2010 hosted by Greece, were involved in a violent argument with local nightclub patrons on the night of 16 March and were arrested by Greek police.
“Frontex is the treasurer of best practices in all areas related to border control and all national officers representing the member states taking part in joint border control operations coordinated by Frontex must uphold the highest standards - both on and off-duty” said Ilkka Laitinen, Frontex Executive Director.
"I have asked the authorities of the Member State which contributed the officers to POSEIDON 2010 to immediately recall them and replace them with other staff members who will be able to work successfully to restore the excellent relations and working spirit which have been in evidence so far” he added.
