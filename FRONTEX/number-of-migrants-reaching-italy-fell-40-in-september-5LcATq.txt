The number of migrants crossing the Central
Mediterranean fell to nearly 12 700 in September, down 40% from the previous
month due to poor weather conditions, although the trend in the first nine
months of this year remained roughly in line with 2015. Most of them were
rescued off the Libyan coast. The total number of migrants who headed to Italy
via the Central Mediterranean route stood at 127 600 in the January-September
period of this year.
