This week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency,
has begun testing the use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) in Greece,
Italy and Portugal to monitor the European Unionâ€™s external borders.

Frontex is exploring the surveillance capability
of the medium altitude long endurance RPAS and evaluating the related cost
efficiency and endurance. The agency will test the unmanned aircraft in several
operational situations. These include surveillance of the sea, support of
Search and Rescue operations, detection of vessels suspected of criminal
activities, such as drug and weapon smuggling and information sharing with multiple
users in real time.In
Greece, the trial that started this week is supported by the Hellenic Coast
Guard, in cooperation with the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority and Air Force.
In Italy, the trial, which is in its last phase of preparations, will be supported
by Polizia di Stato and Guardia di Finanza.
