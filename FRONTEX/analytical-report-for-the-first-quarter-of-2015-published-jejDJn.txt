The first quarter of 2015 saw the
highest recorded numbers of detections of illegal border-crossing and illegal
stay, highlights the latest FRAN (Frontex Risk Analysis Network) Quarterly
report. In fact, detections of illegal border-crossing reached 62 000, which
translates into a 180% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2014.
Whilst the main routes used by migrants did not change, the distribution between
particular border sections shifted.
For the first time, the highest migratory
pressure was in the Western Balkans, at the border between Serbia and Hungary,
where over 33 000 migrants entered the EU. 
Two main factors contributed to this
increase: a high number of nationals of
Kosovo, and a significant increase in the number of migrants arriving in the
Aegean islands from Turkey and then continuing their journey across the Western
Balkans. Among the latter, non-regional migrants, Syrians and Afghans constituted
the majority. 
The first quarter also saw a record number
of asylum requests, with over 181 000 applications filed across the EU. The
majority of asylum applications were submitted in just three countries: Germany, Hungary and Italy. 
Noteworthy is the increase in the number of
migrants entering the EU hidden in lorries, buses and trains. In particular, there
was an increase in the detection of migrants in Bulgaria hiding in cargo trains
arriving from Turkey.
Although the number of detections of
document fraud decreased slightly in comparison with the same period last year,
migrants using fraudulent documents to enter the EU originated from more than
90 countries. Syrians, Moroccans and
Nigerians constituted the majority. Lagos was the top embarkation airport for
false document users, with over 180 fraudsters departing there. 
In the Western Mediterranean, migration
remained at a relatively low level but the number of detections at the land
borders in Ceuta and Melilla quadrupled compared with the previous quarter.
