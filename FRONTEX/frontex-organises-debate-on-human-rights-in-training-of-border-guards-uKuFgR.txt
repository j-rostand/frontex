On 25 November 2008, an open debate on the role of human rights in training of European border guards took place in Prague. With participation of Gil Arias - Frontex Deputy Executive, Angela Li Rosi from UNHCR, Peter Schatzer from IOM and Guy Schmit from ICMPD, the debate focused on the best ways of including human rights in training of border guards in the EU Members States.
The participants shared their experience in providing training of law enforcement bodies across the world, quoting Lampedusa as a good practical example of joint work. The speakers agreed that even though human rights are already included in training modules for border guards, there is space for more cooperation.

Ms. Li Rosi from UNHCR stressed the need for sharing information on best practices among Member States as well as the necessity of harmonization of good implementation practices as a way forward.
The members of the panel agreed that the meeting gave a good opportunity to exchange ideas and define common goals. It showed the willingness of all parties involved to combine forces and stimulates cooperation among the participating organisations.
Mr. Arias concluded that training on human rights is an ongoing process and Frontex, together with international organizations will try to further improve training activities for border guards, which can be implemented in the harmonized way in all Member States.
