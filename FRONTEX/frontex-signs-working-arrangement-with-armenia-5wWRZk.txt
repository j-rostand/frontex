Warsaw, 22 February, 2012 â€” Representatives of Frontex and the competent authorities of Armenia signed a Working Arrangement on Wednesday. Executive Director Ilkka Laitinen represented the Agency while Arthur Baghdasaryan, Secretary of the National Security Council of Armenia, represented the government of Armenia in a signing ceremony in the Armenian capital of Yerevan. This is the sixteenth working arrangement signed between Frontex and the authorities of a non-EU country and aims to establish and gradually develop mutual cooperation on border security-related matters. This is an important tool to facilitate practical cooperation between EU Members States and the competent authorities of Armenia within the framework of intensifying cooperation between the EU and the South Caucasus region. Furthermore, it is intended to contribute to implementation of the Prague Process, which promotes migration partnerships between participating states, and to enhance relationships between the EU and Armenia, especially within the context of the Mobility Partnership, an initiative enabling labour migration between the EU and selected non-EU states.Specific areas covered by the agreement include exchange of information and risk analysis, sharing of experiences and best practices, development of capacity building including professional training, and possible participation in joint operations.
