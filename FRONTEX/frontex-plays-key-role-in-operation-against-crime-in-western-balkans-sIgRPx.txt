Last week, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard
Agency, co-led an international operation against serious and organised cross
border crime in the Western Balkans region. 



The four-day operation, known as Joint Action Day (JAD)
Western Balkans, focused on combatting firearms and drugs trafficking,
irregular migration and document fraud.  It was led by Spain and co-led by
Frontex, Europol, Germany and Bulgaria. In total, 30 countries, eight agencies
and a number of international organisations, including Interpol and UNODC,
teamed up to help the region’s authorities combat crime.
The operation resulted in:
Detection of 14 cases of visa fraud or misuse 

Detection of 71 forged or falsified documents

Detection of 164 clandestine entries

Seizure of 51 firearms and 895 pieces of ammunition 

A coordination centre was set up at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague to
support the exchange of intelligence among the participants. During the
operation, officers from member states performed intensified checks in areas
identified as high-risk based on information collected and analysed in the
centre.
